Excellent p
exelente p
Never stays charged, n
phone has already blown screen and pressing random buttons waste of my money n
I have had an HTC 8X from T-Mobile for more than two years, and for a recent international trip I want to have another phone with me during the trip. Since I want my phone to have the hardware camera and bottom three keys, I found out that 8X was my most economical choice at the time. Since I really love my other 8X, I decided to buy this one.I had a lot of reservation when I first received the product. It was not in the original HTC packaging, did not come with a headset (which I think I had it when I received my T-Mobile one, but not very sure), and with a manual that was not for this phone, but a generic manual for old-time HTC Windows Mobile phones. I had thoughts that it could be a refurbished one, although I could not find sign of usage from the phone itself. One thing surprised me quite a bit was that this is a Verizon version of the phone, instead of an international unlocked.Since I enrolled in the Insider program, my T-Mobile phone is with the latest OS updates. I have to say that I was surprised how many OS update is out there for this Verizon phone: sorry that I did not make a grammatical mistale, the number is exactly ONE. Even before I enrolled to the Insider program, my T-Mobile phone received two or three updates. I guess it's possible that they packaged a series of updates into one, as I really don't remember which feature came with which update. It apparently does not have Cortana, notofication center, and other features come with 8.1. What surprised me more was that I still need to update apps by hand.However, I have to note that, this one does run smoother than my up-to-date phone. I have noticed that, as features were added, sometimes my phone got less snappy (some updates do better than others but that's a different story). Since this phone eventually will become my mom's, I decided I'll leave it as it is instead of getting the new features. She won't use them anyway.So, I have a new copy of my phone, with older OS version. It works great, and works well as my second phone. I liked the camera of my other phone, so I assume I like this one too, although I have not tested it extensively. The sticker is humongous (unlike my T-Mobile one), if that doesn't bother you. I love it, albeit the lack of updates and all others.UPDATE on 13 Feb 2015: Just received updates to Windows Phone 8.1, Update 1 I was told. It runs smoothly, even better than my T-Mobile (Insider) one for some reasons (suspected to be the firmware update). It's great.UPDATE on 20 Feb 2015: Realized a weird issue. Although most functions from the asian GSM provider works fine, this phone cannot send text. It receives fine but cannot send. Seems to be a problem only the Verizon version has. p
Great phone for the price! p
Good p
Everything great p
Perfect p
Very light weight and fast OS. p
I was kind of ssatisfy p
Look, I bought this new. When opening the package it was quiet obvious that this was clearly used with the many smudge marks and abrasions on the back of the case. There was a scratch on the camera lens also. When looking at the screen, it too had many scratches on it. Maybe it was just the seller I bought this from, I don't know... I will promptly return this to the back ally they got this from.. n
THE SELLER WAS VERY NICE, I LOVE ALL THE COLOURFUL FACE, THE CAMERA TAKES GOOD PICTURES AND WINDOWS 8 WAS FAST, THE ONLY PROBLEM I ENCOUTER WAS I COULDN'T TRANSFER MY PICTURES TO MY LAP TOP. SO I RETURNED IT, THE SELLER WAS NICE TO REFUND MY MONEY p
First of all, the good. It's a good phone and I love windows 8. It is my second wp8 phone after the lumia 620 which broke down just out of warranty. Also, it's a beautiful looking phone. The basics work fine such as phone and internet (via cellular and wifi) on ptel.But, it's the Telstra (Australian operator) version. That means the bloatware is more annoying than usual, as it doesn't work. Also, some odd things about the ROM and a potential battery issue.1/ Battery issue, short battery life (looking online, this may improve over time as the phone calibrates, but no indication of that yet)2/ Garmin navigator function works only on Telstra in Australia3/ Other carp such as Foxtel-guide and TelstraOne is also operator specific4/ Wrong model number, is 625b5/ Locked to Australian English in browser ("favourites"(!)) even when "browser & search language" in settings is set to US English6/ Locked to wrong voicemail number7/ Had one instance of scary "lightning bolt and gears" hang in first 2 daysI would not be surprised by this if 3rd party seller but it was Amazon LLC as seller, so I expected a bit better. n
I received this cellular with a crack at the corner of the screen and very dirty...I wait more respect to the costumer, I can't understood how send a merchandise dirty and don't describe with a picture the size of the crack.I bought this cellular for my wife and when she received it and saw the condition gift it to our son. n
Disappointed with the phone. I was looking for a 16GB as they described but in fact it was 8GB. Not sure if it was unlocked or not as it showed many AT&T app's. I wanted an unlocked phone. So sending the phone back and bought another hoping it will be what I'm looking for.Although this is in no way a bad review for the Windows 8 phone. I already have one and absolutely love it. I purchased this one for my husband who is also disappointed that he has to wait a little longer. n
I love the phone, HOWEVER, the sounds are all messed up. They are full of static crackles and die after half a second.... I need good notification sounds for mail/alarms etc. and it's all gone. The phone came without a warranty. I thought Sony is a good company. However, not when it comes to sounds. It's very annoying and I'll have to throw the phone in the garbage.... After googling the issue I found out that Sony DOES have an issue with sounds. So, don't buy it. I can't even play videos that people send me on WhatsApp for instance. I can't make calls on WhatsApp or Hangouts, etc. The other end can't hear me... it's full of static.... imagine that! A phone without good sound... or sound at all.... totally defeats the purpose of a phone.... Am so disappointed, can't tell you.... and am currently not in States, so can't buy something decent to replace it.... How disappointing Sony is..... How can we live in today's world without a phone that provides SOUND?!? Don't ever buy a Sony phone... google this issue.... there's a whold community out there that knows about this sound issue.... n
likeit p
company great but phone blows as do all windows phones.awful operating system.tyhrew it away and went back to android after giving windows phones a two year try n
5 stars p
Excellent p
Screen had a hairline crack under display when I unboxed it n
Best Windows phone, great product, good service seller p
It is good phone p
I received the phone in great timing and it function very well for the most part. However, it did start acting up and I had to return the phone. I was fully refunded and even was given some extra money to pay for the shipping cost (even though it did not completely cover the costs that was still very kind). Overall, great phone I just wished it worked for more than a month. n
i like it p
not unlocked n
I LOVE IT p
excelent p
excellent camera, and excelent OS p
It was beautiful when the phone arrived, brand new and worked fine. Sad to report, over the weekend with no warning the phone wouldn't charge, the red light kept flashing. It cannot turn on, can't do anything, we even tried other chargers, nothing. There was no damage, it just stopped working. We've only had the phone since the end of January which is only 2 months ago. Called the manufacturer, HTC and they said it is out of warranty because it was purchased from a 3rd pary. Thankfully we purchased a 2 year protection plan through square trade and they will honor our claim and return what we paid back to my Amazon.com account, we will mail the phone back to them via Fed Ex at Square Trade's expense. We would like to purchase this same phone again but we are worried. Thanks for letting me share our sad experience. n
excellent phone was expected to recommend it from Venezuela Movilnet, movistar and digitel 3g-powered p
Good p
Pretty good deal!! Phone does come unlocked but I decided to use Verizon prepaid and it's been great!! p
:D p
i love it. very resistent p
The Phone is great! But is refubrished, Not is New! I not return because i live in venezuela, but the phone is great, Windows is the best mobile OS. p
Eventually bricked out after a year or so.. Buy good deal for price p
Phone was a vary good phone it was unlocked and had vary good service but I did not like the windows part of the phone p
Can't explain all. Phone was already defective may be from shipment mishandling. Camera was not working at all. Couldn't hear sound unless speaker was on. Not happy at all looking at $200 worth of product. Returned right away. n
I originally slammed this phone for not being unlocked....Well, it turned out to be unlocked but I still can't rid the start up logo of T-Mobile. Plus the phone's volume rockers on the side are damaged. All things considered, I now have a very nice Windows Phone 8.1(developer preview) for $99 that I use on AT&T/Walmart's $45 GoPhone plan with unlimited talk/text and 1gb data. Not to bad all things considered. Anyone thinking of Windows Phone should go ahead and take the jump. It's a great OS that will only get better if more people would start getting on board. p
Like it. p
Have had this for one day. Worked for a bit and now it is completely broken. Won't charge and screen won't go on. Totally black n
Nice p
Great phone only complaint I didn't realize it was a VERIZON unlocked phone I needed unlocked without provider but was glad they were able to set it up n
CAREFUL!!! Found out the hard way if you are on a T-Mobile network and they send you a Verizion branded phone you are going to have a bad day. You will almost always be in extended network, you will not be able to send text messages most of the time (and especially when you try to send pictures in text messages). They don't mention this to you. Now you can get around the text messaging (you will need to download a program to your computer, then edit the program. The program will act as a proxy server for your phone and will fool the app market place into thinking you have a Nokia phone thus allowing you to download a Nokia program that will finally allow you to edit your APN settings for your texts) So you will be able to text but it will not fix you being constantly stuck on 3g, 2g, extended network, or "H" - You won't see much of any 4G speeds. Just writing this so people are aware (I didn't see this information posted anywhere when I bought mine and my wife's). Yes.... this phone is unlocked and you will be able to use your T-Mobile mini sim card, but you will encounter the previously mentioned issues/problems. n
Wow best phone ever p
HTC 8x, bought it for my wife on October. Only used for a month. Now the screen is blacked out. No warranty on this product n
thanks p
My phone did not come as pictured. There is a Verizon logo printed on the back cover and Verizon apps installed on the phone. Additionally, the User Manual that came in the box was the wrong one, so I now have to go online and download the correct one.Also, while I am not sure of exactly what comes in the box, all I got was the charger and data cable. n
This phone is GREAT. In perfect condition and works absolutely perfectly. HOWEVER, it was not unlocked like the seller claimed and I had to unlock it myself. I only bought this phone because it claimed to be unlocked. Very disappointed. n
I have a problem with how the delivery of these items are done, but Amazon customer service is good and they helped to solve the problem. So far I am loving the phone I miss some aspect of my android but I will adjust. p
Be aware! The phone is not factory unlocked. This is Verizon unlocked and you can get 4G internet only if you use it with Verizon. With AT&T you get 3G and 2G and with T-Mobile you can get only 2G internet. They post a picture of factory unlocked phone but you will see the Verizon label on the back of the phone when you get it, and it doesn't matter if you buy a used one or new one. Unfortunately, I tried both used and new, and they both had the Verizon label.You can see what I got as a new phone in the pictures attached. I have already returned the used one. The picture of the new phone does not show Verizon label so I ordered a new one and again I got a Verizon unlocked phone. I am gonna return it too. n
Love this phone, works as anticipated. Was a little bummed at first to discover it didn't have 8.1 released, but after dev unlocking it and putting 8.1 on it, could not be happier. p
Didn't have the correct carrier labeled on the phone it was at which I don't care for. n
It took 3 days to ship + 4 day to deliver, got what I pay for. Good wrapping p
I bought this phone in September (2014) it was delivered on the 4th and it is now October 21 of the same year. Watch out there is no warranty on this phone and now it won't charge. So we just spent well over a hundred dollars for a little over a month's worth phone service. When it won't work longer than that it wouldn't be worth it at any price. The window closes in 30 days for returns. Don't buy it. n
I liked very much p
Satisfied with the phone... p
exelent p
This is cool, i was a windows man. Now they got 8 cool but in microsoft way. p
I ordered this phone since I was getting bored with the sameness of all Iphones between all the versions and I also was curious to try out the Windows 8.1 OS that this device seemed to support. Overall, I have mixed feelings about the phone.Pros: 1) Very nice finish, Sturdy grip, the lavender color is very unique and becomes a point of discussion(In a good way) 2) The operating system is very nice with some cool features that aren't found in other operating systems 3) The phone is fairly powerful even though it's about 2 years old. Was a bit worried about responsiveness on 8.1, but it's sleek and fast 4) 8MP camera, with 2MP front facing camera. 5) Built-in wireless chargingCons: 1) Only 16GB of space, no scope for expansion. No SD card slot or USB expansion, neither is removeable battery. To be fair, these aren't found in any Iphones either. A 32GB option Would have been very cool. 2) Camera under even medium light is mediocre. Camera very slow in operation. Sometimes, it takes forever to launch the camera app. 3) Limited App store. Most of the major apps are there, but still falls short by margin from both Apple and Android 4) This phone is a verizon branded phone. It's unlocked for sure, but some features won't work in AT&T. E.g., LTE is supposedly supported on this phone, but doesn't work on AT&T networks. You need to manually configure the APN for the sim on AT&T. Not a big deal because instructions easily available on internet. However, the killer was the lack of visual voicemail. If someone calls you and leaves a voice mail, there is no way for you to know it unless you call the voicemail number. To be fair, I think this is a AT&T problem than the phone issue. After spending a few hours with AT&T customer service, I gave up on this. If the visual voice mail worked, I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars, but Since i have been spoilt by Iphone for last 5 years, That's something I am having issues living without. n
My daughter luvs her new phone. p
I really liked the phone with all features p
I just got my phone and it really looks nice and durable. The screen resolution is better than anything I have owned so far. The beats audio does enhance my listening experience but I was surprised to find that it only operates with headphones and not on speaker. Also, I was unable to sync my Google account on the phone, but that's not too much of an issue for me. If you like the simplicity of Windows phones and want an aesthetically pleasing phone, then I highly recommend trying the HTC 8X. p
This phone is fine, but I have issues. It came with poor battery life. It doesn't hold even one full days' charge. Also, it does not synchronize with MS Outlook. I bought this because I was tired of people making fun of my old 2006 Blackberry, but my Blackberry battery lasted for two days, and when I plugged it in to the computer, without doing anything, it would synchronize with Outlook. Any new calendar items I added to my phone would be on my computer, and vice versa. Same with contacts. I am now back to double-entering everything like I did 10 years ago. Welcome forward to the Dark Ages! I am told that there is a 3rd party software that will do the Syncing, but it has had mixed reviews, and it will cost me $40 to find out if it's worth a hoot or not. The phone has some nice features, but it has defined itself to me by what it does NOT have. n
I really liked the product. fully met expectations.Many thanks to you guys!A really good product!Recommend to everyone!! p
got this as a replacement for one of them cheap clone s3 clones (that done work after a week). This is my first windows phone and have to say the OS is way better than i was thinking it would be. yes the phone is Australian carrier branded but works perfect on the straighttalk service. there is more apps and games for the phone than i expected.prosnice choice of apps - gamesphone fits good is hand - and looks really coolgood size screen colours are goodcamera if good front and back16gb memory enough for many people ( not expandable }sound is good through speaker but as soon as you plug ear buds in you will not be able to hear on full volume (very loud)consside and top buttons are a little flush with the unit but can be foundbattery life you may get a days usage if your not a heavy userall in all its a good buy.things to buy for itArmorSuit MilitaryShield - HTC Windows Phone 8X Screen Protector Shield +...(a very thick protector fits over the full screen. that's where i had problems i had to cut a little off the bottom. also it tends to peel a little around the edges i think its to do with the case hitting it ) i think i would go for a dry application protector next timeMYBAT AHTCWIN8XHPCSAAS005NP Advanced Armor Rugged Durable Hybrid Casefits the phone well. soft inner shell with hard case. with kick standif you have any questions about the phone i will reply asp p
The phone is great, I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. But the original carrier is Telstra - an Australian carrier. I was unaware of this before buying the phone. It works great still, but I am unable to send multimedia messages, and at the moment, I cannot access my voicemail (but the voicemail issue can be fixed).I do recommend the phone in general, it's by far one of the best, if not THE best phone I've ever had. But if you have AT&T and want full capability, I suggest looking for one that's originally from AT&T. p
Windows Phone 8 is VASTLY superior to iOS & Android, this coming from someone who has recently used all three mobile OS's. 8X's hardware is very impressive as well, very fluid and responsive phone. Feels very light and comfortable to hold. The display is bright and colors vivid. I'm currently using T-Mobile 4g, but I'm not 100% sure this phone supports LTE as T-Mobile doesn't have LTE in my area. p
So this is my first windows phone experience.I was hesitant to buy this device at first. Im eyeing Nexus 4 for a replacement for my current smartphone. But I was really amazed by its features and considering that this is from HTC and its unlocked, how lucky can I get?I ordered the california blue color. When I booted the phone I was curious at the T logo. So I search on the net and I found out that my HTC 8X is from Telstra Australia. Meaning the device is 4G LTE capable.To be honest, I really love android, I love its ecosystem and features. There's nothing about it that I hate. But I am a Windows type of kid. I've learned how to use word processor on windows, my first program runs on windows. So going back to me opting for WP8 as my new phone. I was really amazed how Microsost managed to create such a brilliant mobile o.s. It's just lovable. Very simple yet unique. Thought it might not be customizable compared to android it still has something that makes it stand out from other Mobile o.s.Overall, this is really a great device. I will recommend it to my friends who own other mobile platform device. p
This is my second 8x and they both have had the same issues. When listening to music using with headphones the volume will randomly increase to full volume. Without headphones, no issues. The charge port on the base of the phone will start to be picky about the position of the charger after a while. Not a big problem most of the time because you will figure it out but every once in a while you will be frustrated because your phone did not charge. Other than that I love the phone and the Windows OS. p
i was extremely happy when i bought this phone. i couldn't wait to start uising it. the first thing i checked when i started using the phone was the internet sharing(hotspot), to my suprise it keeps telling me "tethering option on this device is not enable, go toat&t website or call 611" which is useless for someone in africa!. and to make matter worse this particular phone came with 8G memory! n
I had a Windows Phone 7.5, good but with a simple external style. Now I'm feeling great. I love the new live tiles and I think that the HTC style is just perfect. :) p
Pros. This phone is fast beautiful and slim. The operating system is gorgeousCons. The camera dedicated button is redundant in my opinion and I am afraidto press it by mistake.Before hand I had iPhone and In all I am very happy with my new HTC and windows 8. p
very good product. p
Good phone. The only problem is windows block certain app I would have like to use n
Phone works good p
its new phone overall good. if its work in bangladesh i will be happy. p
Really a great phone. If your interested in Windows phone, this is a sure bet. p
its ok p
excellent p
many problems with the SMS used Movistar (Venezuela) n
great phone p
had a problem getting it to work, but it works fine now p
When I received it, I was shocked at first because it looks like the vendor shipped me an European version with an European power adapter. Since I have another USB power adapter, I decided to plug it in and charge the new HTC wildfire S instead of shipping it back. After powering up the wildfire s, I was able to change the language setting to English and then it just works just like a U.S. version. Everything work very nicely afterward.This is a very fast cellphone come with a very nice camera. The phone is entirely unlocked and I am able to use my T-mobile sim card with it.Nevertheless, the vendor should really indicate that this is not a U.S. version phone.I gave 5 stars for the phone but 3 stars for the vendor. p
Bought for my girlfriend and she loves it. She always wanted a touchscreen phone, and figured out this will be ideal for her. It's not too big or small, fits nice in her hand, and she's enjoying the beauty of Android. Even though it was her first actual touchscreen device, it didn't take her long to get use to it. Now it looks owned it for years. p
Phone is decent; right size; this is a foreign model - looks like made for Pacific Asia; however, works well in USA p
This was my introductory phone to Touch Screen cell-phone.Pros.* Always liked small phone I can fit in my pants' pocket easy. This one does.* Graphics are clean.* GPS and WiFi capability* Can be used as WiFi router, but with a downside (see Cons under connectivity)* Screen is quite strong for a little guy. I never used a screen protector and I have no scratches after a year and a half.* IT takes decent photos (5MP)* Sound recorder is awesome. I recorded a conversation (kind of spying) and had it in my pocket. Voices were clear.Con's.* Connectivity: it is only EDGE band. Using it as a WiFi router for my tablet was not fast enough, making it USELESS to have this capability.* The RAM is only 600MB.* Can not handle a memory card larger than 8GB (I only tried a 4GB one, but I assume it could take an 8GB one) I did try a 14GB one without success.This is a good phone for a kid (10-15) whose parents are wise to realize that to spend $500 on cell phone is ludicrous. n
I like a lot my new cel it's small but great screen, I can navigate, watch videos and my kids love android apps! Kindly p
its a nice phone but i thought it waz bigger,very small,wish i can exchange for something different and bigger for me n
It's cute and high quality considering its price. There is no visible flaws been found now. I like HTC style, it deserved. p
I purchased this product and was expecting a fully unlocked handset. Upon arrival to Bangkok for usage, I quickly learned the handset was not data unlocked, and only voice/SMS (SIM) unlocked. I took the handset to MBK mall and some phone ninjas were able to unlock the data piece for THB 700 (about $23USD). Afterwards, the 3G components worked fine on AIS and DTAC SIMs/plans.Not sure if this was a Thai anomaly but be warned the handset I received was not fully unlocked as advertised. Be prepared to have a plan/time/funds in place to fully unlock the handset. Other than this - the phone is Vodaphone with a 220V charger, and I was able to upgrade to Gingerbread 2.3.5 (via WiFi) before the ninjas hax0red it for me. However, I feel this handset is essentially locked in at the current OS level, as the 3G unlock could possibly be removed if I upgrade the OS (unknown, but am not going to risk it at this point...)Phone is small, lightweight, easy to use, and has a good battery life. I recommend it for those who need something when traveling overseas. Just be ready to unlock the data piece if necessary. n
use this phone 2 and a half months, works good.I have a incredible s and it's broken, so this phone is a sort of replacement, it obviously cannot compare with the incredible s, but it do it's job, so I cannot complain this. The battery life is good, actually impressed me. I also noticed the phone is from Europe, and it's rooted.the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the camera is somehow reddish, makes the photos look really awkward.ps. I don't notice when the price drop to $205, I purchased it for $225.74!!! p
Great little phone but it will not work on 3G in the USA. Other reviewers said this works on T-Mobile, well it does, but only on their old 2G GSM/EDGE network. This phone only works on HSPA/WCDMA 900/2100 MHz (TMob USA needs 1700 AND 2100). GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 also work but for 2G only.AT&T 3G network uses 850/1900 so this phone will not work at 3G speed on that either.If you're planning on using the phone in the USA don't buy this version. p
Good entry-level android phone from htc. But I surprised the phone was not supporting Arabic, because it is not Middle East version. n
Worked n
thank you p
very good p
This phone wasn't a A510e which is a HTC Wildfire S. It was a A3333 which is an HTC Wildfire. The packaging was generic and didn't look like a genuine HTC phone. The battery wasn't installed in the phone as is done with HTC Wildfire's and it wasn't a genuine HTC part. This phone is questionable in my opinion! n
I absolutely loved this phone until I realized it was the UK version. Can't root, and the internal memory is EXTREMELY LOW, so it's unusable by any of today's standards unless it's rooted. Really really wish it was US version. Gave it to my three year old since it was only good for a couple games and phone calls. n
So far, this purchase is satisfying, no complaints, my girl love the phone, this is her first android, so it is a new experience for her and a great starter phone... p
It's a nice phone and everything described is properly working, the only limitation is its internal storage space. It is really low and it can't allow you to have many apps on your phone n
El HTC Wildfire S es el sucesor del HTC Wildfire, con una mejor pantalla HVGA y Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread. Posee una pantalla touchscreen de 3.2 pulgadas, cÃ¡mara de 5 megapixels, Wi-Fi b/g/n, GPS, Bluetooth y ranura para tarjetas de memoria microSD. p
I was very pleased with my purchase it showed up within the time frame givin. the only problem i had with the phone was that it had a lingering cig smoke smell to it but other than that great phone. she has my reconmendation!!!! p
i got my phone quick and was what i was expecting the package was in like new but the box said it had a microSD card (preinstalled) but there was no card other than that all was well thnaks p
I adore my phone and that is why I will recommend without hesitation. A great inexpensive smart phone. For my purposes, it does everything as all of the other smart phones (except one that will remain nemeless). I use it for every- thing online.Thank you p
this phone has no internet access. Its a rip-off n
Dont work. Obsolete sofware n
Too small n
Some issues n
is not good product. i dont like, because don work. n
could not use on my plan p
there is not actualizations for this phone since 2009 n
Hard to type on it, keyboard too small, otherwise it served it's purpose p
Don't buy this piece of s***I bought it for my uncle back in India from USA. It didn't work in India (although they say it's unlocked). BLACK SCREEN!! NO CHARGING!I asked my friend to get it repaired...they run diagnostic and let me know that motherboard is faulty. n
This phone is useless....my biggest goofed up purchased from amazon. I purchased two...took them to jamaica...they both initially connected to the system there but never worked. n
much better than iphone of the same era. has trackball,has easy replaceable battery, better graphics,better design, made of mag,just the right size for a phone, with no contract; just pop in sim card & go... p
I can't really offer a full proper review of this phone because I am using it on a substandard network (Roshan in Afghanistan). But I can say that the features that I am able to access are awesome. The touchscreen interface is really good and the menu set up is intuitive. The music player is easy to navigate and just as simple to use as an iPod. The camera/camcorder are clear. The touch keyboard is responsive and doesn't require a hard press to get the letter up. Conversation style texting is an added bonus. Audio clarity is excellent. All in all this is the best phone that I have ever owned. I will update this with a more detailed review when I get to really explore everything on the phone when I get to use it on a better network, Four Stars until then (I don't want to give it the highest mark until i get the full experience). p
Tempted by a 5 megapixel camera, a touch screen and google operational system, I thought: that's it! here I have an iphone without the life bonds imposed by this brand, a pretty good camera for a mobile, and google-like neatness for doing complex tasks in simple ways. However, I was disappointed in all fronts.The ergonomics of the device is overly poor - certainly well below iphone's. The main proof is its own manual of instructions which, with more than two hundred pages, is unfortunately needed for users to be able to use many basic commands that cannot be accessed intuitively. So the simplicity of use and intuitiveness that is such a great part of Google success sadly were not translated into this operational system (e.g.: I tried to switch to another gmail account in this device and for now I gave up, as I couldn't find how to do it)Another example is the physical keys (it has several ones), which need a considerable force to be pressed (resulting for instance that the mobile is not comfortable to operate with one hand only). But in contrast to the toughness of dealing with the mechanical buttons, the interaction with the touchscreen is hyper-sensitive to the finger touch, so you often end up activating commands you don't want to - like calling to phone numbers when in fact all you wanted was to navigate in the agenda, or opening applications (or even sending then to the trash bin) when all you wanted was to browse among the screen (actually that can happen even when the mobile is left alone in your pocket)Small details can be annoying too: the horizontal mode of the screen does not allow you to finish the task you started (so you cannot send the text you wrote without going back to the vertical mode). When you want to see your files, there is no the option of just plugging the mobile into the USB port of your computer. You have first to "mount" (process not intuitive - again you need to have read the manual) and after that, "unmount" the mobile.And finally, the camera is sincerely bad. Forget the idea of having it as a substitute for a digital camera (as I used to do with my old mobile Nokia N95) mainly when it comes to take pictures when flash is needed, as the camera has no flash.overall - and also taking into account the high price of the unlocked version- a bad deal. n
The Desire is excellent in all aspects, from performance to customization capabilities. The only problem is the battery that requires charging at best after 2 days. If you use the phone it may get you through the day. p
HTC arrived at such a perfect design --- simple, no-BS, perfect size, gorgeous screen, no nonsense --- that my only fear is that they will decide they need to change it just to change it.Best of all are the PHYSICAL BUTTONS.The only weak point is the battery life. But that is part of having a powerful, compact phone -- would I want it to be a bit bigger and heavier to accomodate a bigger battery? Not so sure.By the way, there is the issue of the Desire on T-Mobile, since the Desire is not compaible with T-Mobile's funny frequency. It WORKS FINE on T-Mobile, but on their 2G, not 3G, network. You have to set the stuff on the phone (easy) and have T-Mobile set it on their end. p
I'm using it in Brasil - SÃ£o Paulo (Vivo), just switched de SIM card and it worked perfectly.I suggest buying some screen protector. Mine just got a little scratch in 2 weeks. p
The model name is just perfect Desire. Desire to keep using it until a better phone comes to the market. The touch screen is very responsive , the phone is sexy, the Droid system (2.2) is amazing!! The only complaint is the battery the doesn't last too much, but mind you that happens with every smart phone if you keep using internet,gps,music, etc. Thank you Amazon!!!!! p
Had the phone for two weeks now and have run into a few problems. One minor problem was the language setting. The phone came from Amazon with settings for english but only from Asian countries (Vietnam, Malaysia, Pakistan etc...). No U.S. or British english settings. I found a video on YouTube on how to fix this but it involved downloading files and resetting the phone. A major pain! Not something I should of had to deal with right after taking it out of the box.The most significant problem, however, is lack of a 3G connection and no internet connection when outside a wifi hotspot. The internet simply does not work when connecting through your carrier. Lots of people around the world have this same problem and have found various was of making it work. Unfortunately, none of those suggestions have worked for me so far. Someone posted that HTC is aware of this problem and working on a fix, but so far, nothing. This would be a fantastic phone if those problems were fixed. If you are set on getting the HTC Desire, I would wait until the bugs are worked out. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the trouble. n
I ordered this phone to replace my iPhone 4 on the ATT network and use while traveling with overseas SIM cards. Additionally, I am trying to migrate away from Mobile Me and this looked like a great option. I really like the phone and the HTC Sense interface is quite nice. However, this phone does not operate on the correct frequency for the ATT's 3G data network, so all data is transfered via the EDGE network which has slow data speeds. Unfortunately, I returned the phone.If you want 3G speeds on ATT, make sure the phone operates on 850/1900 3G frequencies for data. Even tough this phone operates on 850/900/1800/1900 GSM frequencies the data frequencies are 900/2100 which ATT does not support. n
The HTC Desire is a great phone and I've been using it for about 4 moths now. The only thing I can complain about is the battery life but I'm guessing it's very similar to other smart phones. p
I've been using the HTC Desire for about a month now, and I'm very, very satisfied with it. Purchased in the US to be used in Brasil, it is working wonders with a local service provider SIM.First off, the phone's design is not as groundbreaking as the iPhone - to me the iPhone 4 is the best looking phone so far - but it's not without its qualities. It has a clean and discreet design, and I like it that way.The Android OS with the Sense UI runs very smoothly with the 1 GHz processor built on this phone. The applications run slick, and no problems in multitasking. The screen is very sharp and very bright, the touch control is fast and accurate, pleasant browsing experience and lots of apps to boost your phone from the Android market.Call quality hasnt been an issue yet, no dropped calls so far. Signal reception is good, and call sound is... well, ok for a phone. The music player is very good, although it lacks an equalizer (I dont really miss it though, because music playback quality is good enough without EQ when using a better pair of headphones than the standard - I'm using the Klipsch Image S4).I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to steer clear of the control freaks at Apple, without any sacrifices (look for the reviews around the web, some sites rate the HTC Desire higher than the iPhone 4, and that means something). p
It was delivered ahead of the estimated time and the phone is great and has lots of features. I use this phone when I travel out of the country. p
El equipo llego en perfecto estado,funciona bien, el unico inconveniente es que es una version internacional europea y no tiene idioma espaÃ±ol. Lo solucione instalando del market morelocale2 y listo. p
A nice product but very limited in internal memory for additional appsIf you put a navigation app like IGO you are doneNo more space for additional appsIn addition heat up when gps apps are active or intensive web activityAnd ran out of battery.Buy if u use it as phoneDon't if you expect more n
So.... after much deliberation i decide on the HTC 8181 Desire........ And for the week it worked it was a fantastic handset.However after just 7 days the speaker in the handset stopped working..... just like that. Phone never fell, never got wet, nothing. The speaker-phone and head phones worked fine but the normal handset speaker... not so much.So after being a Nokia owner for almost 20 years I regret having switched to HTC... and for US $400. I hope Amazon/HTC provides me with a FULL refund as i am not sure i want another HTC phone. n
I Love my new phone so much. Its perfect, but I know it would be slightly inferior to some newer phones out in the market. But this phone is definitely the best in its genre. p
As most of the people writting, it is in fact a great android phone, brother of the Nexus One. AMOLED vs SLCD=> No sense to compare. But potential buyers, specially those located outside the US, must be warned of the fact that international version mean that one item will be randomly taken from stock and shipped to you..and its configuration can be to anyplace , japanesse, chinesse, and in my unfortunatelly case, for arabian market. The difference is the preloaded applications through ROM memory. I bought an international version thinking that maybe, the cellphone could come with some spanish apps or otherwise some european apps (like language system, news, etc.). But when I received the apparatus and turned it on, Problems started. First: Only two languages to choose for operating system; English/Arabic. Fortunately I understand some english and said 'its ok but wish i have found spanish option'. Second: Found some muslim apps, at ROM level and it means that I cannot remove it, Specially one irritating program which reminds the muslim pray time by "singing" a chorus and there were no way to make it to stop neither by forcing it to stop through settings. It made me to be on the verge of flashing the OS. Fortunatelly, and looking through the Web I found the way to make a soft reset and now the program is still there but inactive. Third: Apps related with weather, time and world clock had preloaded arabic cities. In this case it was relatively easy to remove and change cities. Finally, I found some additional apps to compose with spanish dictionary. Finally today I'm fine with the device but after one week of thoroughly visit forums, setting it, etc.I suggest that everybody interested in one of this device, just buy domestic version. After all, I'm sure that ironically, it comes with spanish language option and whatever apps it brings, it always will be closer for europe and latinamerica than this "International version". p
Excelente celular! Muito rÃ¡pido e estÃ¡vel. Nunca havia usado o Android e achei fantÃ¡stico. A loja de aplicativos possui diversas opÃ§Ãµes gratuitas e pagas. O Ãºnico ponto negativo Ã© a duraÃ§Ã£o da bateria, cerca de 1 dia usando moderadamente. p
Hi, my device isn't working anymore... I contact UK Repair Centre, but I need a proof of purchase to have it repaired, how can I proceed? n
When choosing a smart phone i had done a lot of research and came up with two options at the time, HTC and Samsung. Samsung is great, but HTC has a little more innovation and technical aspects which i like and the HTC Desire is great at it. I had previously owned a HTC Desire HD, but it fell and the screen cracked after a couple days of use and even after repairing it, i jus didnt want it again, but the phone was superb, great UI, physical feel and jus overall construction. While searching for a replacement, i came right back to HTC and took a second look at the Desire. Not only that, but my gf wanted a smartphone as well. I ordered the first one from WorldwideDistributors through Amazon, with excellent delivery time and an excellent product too. Moving on the phone now......Pros of HTC Desire.Great size.Sturdy Feel.Hardware Specs are great for the price.Camera is up to par.AMOLED screen is superb.The HTC Sense UI is wonderfully easy to use.Cons of HTC Desire, these are the make or break things for u, trust me.Battery Life is just average abt day and a half max with moderate to heavy use (Samsung Galaxy S i9000 is much much better, but so is the price i guess).Internal memory Sucks, jus over 150mb to store apps (didnt see this as a problem as i rooted mine and can store apps on the sd card).No folder support, u cant make folders in the UI, u have to attach to the computer as a SD card and manually create folders (not very user friendly in that aspect).No more Android support, from what i have read, HTC is only going to release support up to Android 2.2 Froyo so if ur looking for something more up to date software wise, need to get something else..Just being petty i guess, but when in ur pocket, the speaker does not ring loud enough and u may have some missed calls.Overall what sold me on this phone is the price, it was very reasonable for the hardware, even though WW had it a couple dollars extra, u pay for service which is no problem for me. I bought one for my gf and after seeing how excellent the phone was for me, i ordered a second one jus for me from the same distributor. If u purchase this phone and u are keen on protection, which ive learnt about since i dropped my Desire HD, there are two cases u can get, the OtterBox Commuter series case (much better than the Defender series by far) or the Case-Mate Tough case, which to me is the best case overall, way better protection.I hope this review has helped u decide if the HTC Desire is right for u, i love it, but its not everyones cup of tea and the main personal judging point is if ur a geek and like to dig in to ur tech go for it, if ur one of those ppl that jus want to buy and use and dont care abt the workings too much, not the best option for u, though it is still an option.Enjoy!!! p
Hi, HTC Desire is a best of the best, except it has so many software issue, including camera pics keep disappearing and so many other users are facing the same issue but no explanation from HTC due its open source, think before u buy. i am also in tension spent $545 and this is what i ma getting a tension. n
good quality works great with any phone company in the US, Canada and Mexico p
AS DESCRIBED, GOOD PHONE BACK IN THE DAYS, LOVED IT p
It was locked n
Very good p
good p
This is a 2009 version and the seller doesn't tell us that, is a limited version. The android version has ceased to be operational it can't be update and for that you can't have any new apps or update it n
The Phone doesn't look like a new one. The package contains no warranty or manual details. I think the phone might used by someone and internal parts are replaced. Don't buy this one. n
I ordered a HTC A8181 from the seller last year,but he mailed me a ADR6275 which is much cheaper than A8181, there is no place to insert a SIM's card and can only be used for US cellular. I wanted to return it, but he did not agree. n
Amazing phone and it definitely did fulfil its years as it was battered by my child and of course by the wife! p
Economical in price, not too big, yet good experience as a smart phone.The only drawback is the lesser internal memory available. p
Excelente Telefono, no tiene nada que envidiarle a un iphone, gran cantidad de aplicaciones en Android Market, muy rapido, interface intuitiva, hasta ahora todas las aplicaciones se ejecutan muy bien, lo he probado con sim cards de los 3 operadores telefÃ³nicos en Venezuela y funciono adecuadamente, el Ãºnico inconveniente que se debe tener en cuenta es lo poco que dura la bateria , opte por comprar un cargador de automovil ,en definitiva excelente inversiÃ³n. p
Excellent product the shipper did an excellent job in terms of delivering the product within a very short period and also the product itself is simply beautiful and highly effective...my only concern about this phone is the built in internal memory it is actually too small and u will run out of memory very shortly specially if you are planning on downloading many applications from the android market...other than that it is one of the most powerful phones in the market.... p
The phone comes with Android 2.2, It comes with a 4GB Memory card ( this is not mentioned in the phone specs). Great phone. No issues. I am using it in India. p
And the reasons for that pronouncement are twofold, costs less than half the price unlocked, unbranded and does as much or more without being locked into the confining world of Mr. Jobs. Android, Snapdragon processor (whatever that is-for me it could be a SnapTulip and I wouldnt know the difference. I only know it is fast). Really I don't know what else you can do with a cell phone. The battery is a tad weak but is rumored to improve after a few depletions and charges. Excellent phone. p
This is a great phone, the only thing I don't like is that it does not support T-Mobile 3G frequency for internet access, Edge is very slow. As some reviewers have indicated battery life is not that great, but I don't know of any smart phones that have great battery life when used to access the internet, check e-mail etc. You learn to manage battery capacity by knowing what functionality consumes the most power. All in all excellent device. p
Well, I bought this phone for the Android Operative System, It already came with the Froyo Update, all the cool features were enabled (Menu navigation, HD Video Recording, etc...) the widgets are just excellent, useful and some of them are for fun, like the Friend Stream, which allows you to have your Facebook/Twitter updates in a single window, another nice widget is the Weather, it locates you where you are, if I move to a different city, it will show the current position and the weather (Data transmission required). The camera is Fantastic, it take excellent pictures and HD Videos with Great quality.The phone itself is not too heavy, very comfortable in your hands and so intuitive to use, the Android OS manage everything in such a fantastic way (Phone alerts, text messages, widgets, visual effect) you really enjoy using the phone, I had some problems setting up the Internet for my Service Provider (I thought I already had active, but no =P)but I finally did it, it works like a charm I am able to access Internet and a very smooth way, use my Mercury Messenger application (Downloaded from Android Market), download music, everything; I really like the way how the phone manage my Emails (Email Widget by HTC), you have the option to see just the headers, a little of the message or the whole message. The "People" Application (By HTC) allows you to link your phone contact with their Facebook/Twitter/Flickr account, you can select which picture from the services you want to use as a contact picture, if the contact updates that picture, it will be updated in your phone too, you can see all the contact's updates from the People application to have more specific information about that contact specifically. The phone Works really fast (It has never froze with me) even though I have many applications running in background, remember that the amount of applications you have running at the same time is proportional to the battery consumption, besides of the Social Network applications it also has some business applications, like the PDF viewer and Quick Office.Finally, in my opinion is such a great phone for a young guy with social network addiction, like to a Business man that uses his phone to stay in contact. p
I got the international unlocked GSM model with waranty to use it all over the world!Now I set down in Brazil with a phone that freezes after 5 mins. of use. Have don all the suggestions HTS-support give about the freezing problems, but still keeps freezing!Tried to talk to HTC-support US they told me to contact HTC-Support in Brazil and Brazil told me to contact FRANCE!!!!...the biggest joke in the world!!!!!If you google the Desire you will find that there is a lot of people with the same problem and it looks like HTC don't have a solution to the problem!!!Therefor my recommendation for now: DON'T BUY THE HTC DESIRE PHONE at this moment 01.05.2011!!!!!My HTC repair ticket number from the US 10USCW52ENA001558 (if anybody from HTC read this!!!) n
This is an excellent phone, is truly awesome, but.... I bought this phone (International Version) from this seller FGS, brown and everything, the only problem I got, was that the international version results to be Indian Version, that means, it has only 1 language English (India), Android allowed me to install an application to change the language, however, some text still appears in English, I think it should be explicit in this publication.Beside that language problem, the phone is outstanding, I'm truly happy with its performance and capacity, the battery "drain problem" is fixed with Juice Defender application, therefor, I think is excellent and you should buy it with eyes closed.I rated with 4 stars because I kindda feel this is a "tricky" publication. p
Excellent. Let's do Amazing!The best experience with this cell fone. Very easy use the HTC sense. There are all functions for day by day. Don't wait more... buy now. p
I simply entered my SIM and all was running,the phone did upgrade over WiFi with no issues.realy good phone in a good price. p
The HTC Inspire is not 4G on the T-Mobile Network and I can't get the WIFI-Hotspot to work. I wish the sellers would have advised the buyers that the wifi hotspot doesn't work on the T-Mobile network and it is not 4G. n
good afternoon mr seller this is to tell the day Wednesday April 30 received the cell phone to buy one of them came with a flaw, I comment on first day worked perfectly but the second day I took a photo and turn off I thought it was no load on the battery, on the third day it was functioning as normal and turn off, until this day has refused to turn. I know the warranty is for a month but I am in Caracas - Venezuela and parcel service is slow to bring my article for this reason can not do the reglamo in 30 days ...I would like to help me resolve this situation with the phone because I quite like the phone model and which fits my purchasing power.I await your response. n
I bought this to replace another HTC inspire that quit after about 3 years of good service. I have occasionally had a few software problems with this model but overall this is a great older phone at a reasonable price. Newer phones have more bells and whistles but this is a good smartphone. p
I bought this phone for my wife. She really likes the large bright screen and ease of use. I'm now considering replacing my i-phone with one of these as well. p
Thanks p
This phone is a good phone, the only thing is it was not unlocked, I had to pay an extra 40 bucks to unlock it go figure false advertising n
Nice upgrade if your not use to smart phones. Nice screen and really easy to use. Don't forget to get the memory card! p
This is my second time purchasing this phone, that's how much I like it. I have two young sons and this phone sees a lot of abuse. Good size, rugged, and good battery life.I'm an AT&T customer and didn't have any trouble with phone being locked. p
This person has sent me a phone that did not work, the same day I received it I try to connect to Metro PCS and there being Miss you program the phone told me that the phone was damaged, and unable to read the SIM Card. I paid $ 124.49 for the phone has only given me $ 59.75, I expected that returned in full payment or send me another phone ... plus I made him quitarda poor exchange rate to return me the $ 59.75 n
Received my phone put it all together the battery was at half charge. Was unable to charge the phone again. not sure if it is a bad phone or a bad battery. The charging port doesn't seem to be right. Was very dissatisfied with this product! n
Was good I like it and now I'm looking for a used apple loptop can u help me to find that? p
i did not like this phone because I could not use it at all >> t mobile didn't work . n
the phone exceded my expections, that I bought two plus decorative covers for them.the large screen is great for e mail and texting. p
Defective phone, I really recommand anyone. I bought that phone brand new and 2days after the speakers stoped working. Just don't buy it. n
I was very very disappointed. This was the second HTC A9192 Inspire 4G. When my daughter received the first phone, she was so very excited because she was getting an early Christmas gift to take pictures and send them to her friends. She was not able to send nor receive pictures. We took the phone to T-MOBILE and they changed the settings but it still did not work so we returned it and purchased another. Amazon tried to make it right by sending it 2 days deliver so we would have it before Christmas but the delivery was delayed and I did not receive the phone till Christmas Eve. I returned from work on Christmas eve and learned that the new phone did not work. I took it to the AT&T store and they told me that the phone was damaged as it would not stay on, even after being charged overnight. Now, it will be a sad Christmas because not only could my daughter not take pictures but she does not have a phone. n
It's a nice phone. The only thing is I wish it had a front facing camera also but other than that is ok p
I bought the red 9192 HTC inspire and was very satisfied its a great phone and the customer service was awesome I would recommend this company 5 times out of 5 I recieved it in a timely manner and unlocked just as it was avertised p
Phone (HTC Inspire) arrived with a dead battery. Tablet Distributors immediately issued a refund for the cost of a battery, plus a little extra for the trouble I went to in troubleshooting the issue. Would recommend them and the phone. p
The charger that came with it does not charge it and the battery does not keep the charge for long , screen freezes very often especially when there's an incoming call n
The battery stopped working after a week of use. It turns off for no reason, and sometimes won't turn back on for a while. n
I love my phone, battery has to be charged everyday which kinda sucks, but it shows video nicely, its lightweight and slim to slip in your pocket. Its great. Speakers are a bit High pitched though, but I guess HTC solved that with the later models. Yes I would reccomend this to someone else p
Great phone, but battery has minimal performance, you have to charge this phone constantly. The seller was fantastic when I had a problem with original purchase. Replacement phone works as advertised. HTC makes a great product but needs to provide a better battery for longer life. p
good phone for cheap, had an iphone3g before but this phone is the best much much better than the phone i used to use. p
This phone is the best its everything that i expected it to be. The phone came right on time and it was very easy to track it as well. I would recommend this product to everybody i know. p
As per the description we should receive unlocked phone but we received the locked phone that too in the AT&T Box.Not sure whom to ask and why they sent it like that. I thought Amazon is good in sending the items for the buyers but its kind of cheating the customers. Please be careful if you are buying this phone. n
When video is playing or an audio podcast if u turn the phone to landscape view or back to portrait view it will skip. By skip I mean it goes onto the next podcast. It does the same thing when I listen to Pandora radio I.e. Changes on it's own to the next song without my hitting the next advance button. I have tried shutting off the accelerometer but his has not helped at all. I a convinced this is one of the bad batches that HTC made. Or I at least had the impression HTC made good phones. n
This phone is surprisingly heavy, which I liked.It is very slow when you power it on. That drives me nuts.Otherwise, decent smartphone. p
I received the phone about 3 weeks ago and has been in use for exactly a week today but since day 1 it has had issues. Once it is in use for a while it will get so hot and randomly turn off!! Total waste of my money!!!?? n
Great phone! Used it for quite some time and it worked perfectly! ran apps and games smoothly and never had any issues of the phone getting hot or anything. Used the wifi all the time, no problems there either. Only issue was that I could never find cases for it. Other than that, great phone! p
GOOD PHONE p
This phone came out of the box with a few minner scratches on the sides but if you put a cases on it you can't see it. It was a great phone so I thought for the first week. And after that it became very slow. I didn't even have much downloaded but like Facebook twitter and Instagram. An I also had a 64gb sd card added with all downloaded on it. So I don't know why it was doing this. n
I still use this phone i have net 10. I have really have good service and still going strong. p
Not satisfied n
The phone performs ax expected. The camera is good. Do wish it had a front facing camera but its ok. Its used as a secondary phone for international travel and has performed well p
Phone stopped working after a month of having it. Contacted seller just to ask about it no response. n
THE PHONE STOPPED WORKING AFTER 1 MONTH. THEN AMAZON TOLD ME I CANT RETURN I BROUGHT IT FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND I AM SO DISAPPOINTED NOW I WILL OPT FOR A BLU LIFE PLAY I HAVE A BLU STUDIO 5.5 COULD NOT BE ANY BETTER. THIS IS SUCH A GROSS DISAPPOINTED I TOSSED IT IN THE BUSHES IN JAMAICA. n
Great phone. Had over two yewatres. Dependable. p
Was not pleased at all the phone came without a charger so once I did receive it which took a while it was almost dead bought all kinda chargers finally purchased the battery pack but the phone was just messed up wouldn't come on then I had to pay to return it the phone had been returned for 3 days they didn't get back with me about refund I message them and finally got refund the next day. n
One of my favorite smart phones ever. I have owned several of these. I would own another if they were cheaper. It seems like the quality of HTC went down after this model. Camera quality and features are the best feature of this phone. p
nice phone p
battery last no time n
Used for approximately month and half, battery over heated and was unable to use. according to Amazon policy not able to get refund n
as described p
This is a great phone I would buy it again . p
Kept dropping calls n
Fast shipping. Phone is perfect. p
great phone looks good. performance wise the battery takes long time to charge, most of the time cannot watch videos, get stuck. doesnt get full wifi. its a very heavy phone. love the animations. p
i like it very nice phone p
where too begin... thw HTC ARRIVE isnt all that. ive had this phone for about three weeks, i originally got the phone as a replacement for the s3. worst decision i ever made. the phone doesnt connect to the internet unless its wifi, and ive been on several calls with costumer care and gone into 3 different retail stores and none off them have been able too get it too connect to the carriers data.. its a pretty cool phone. their hasnt been an update on the phone for a while and the internet browser is like a 20010 browaer video quality sucks. i havent been able too download a single application on this phone. too get music you have to download zune on to youre pc... this phone is the most complicated phone i have ever had. best advices is not too get it. n
I've been using this phone over six months now. I really like having a keyboard to type on, rather than just a screen. I bought this phone after owning a Galaxy S2 for that reason. At first the screen tilt can be a little annoying, but I got used to it fast.\The Windows Phone OS is really streamline and works without any glitches. The only flaw is that the Microsoft app store is practically empty compared to the Android or iOS marketplaces. And as one who listens to a lot of Pandora radio, I was disappointed to learn that there is no official Pandora app for Windows phones, and there are no plans for one to be made. There are some 3rd party Pandora apps you can use, but they don't seem to work as well and crash a lot.Overall, good phone, good OS, nearly worthless app store. Hopefully now that the surface and Windows 8 are out people will start developing more apps for Windows devices, but if not, it will be back to Android for me. n
I absolutely love the phone! It is so fast and never gets bogged down no matter how many things I am doing at once. I had to usually clear all my conversations on my androids because they would load soooo slowly but with this phone I have my conversations going back for months and it is still just as fast as when I first got the phone. Battery life is normal. Turns on faster than any other phone I have ever seen. Takes about 10 seconds to start up. Over all this is a great phone. p
This phone came well packaged and the seller's description was spot-on. I have not found any defects after almost a month of service. Windows 8 is taking some time to get used to. There were a few settings (e.g. font size and an easier on/off system) on the Blackberry Curve I had, but this phone is out of the Blackberry's league.One problem is the redial or flash to call area at the top of the phone's screen. I kept hitting it with my ear and hanging up on people. Another is the placement of the volume button. Your hand/fingers support the phone right at that button while typing and using the camera (any landscape use).Overall I think this is a fine product. p
my wife loves this phone!she tells everybody about this phone,its to bad sprint doesnt make a windows *!!!!!!! great job p
Short learning curve. Battery life is about 8-10 hours.Great keyboard. Receives and sends text by voice in my car. Excellent screen. Good reception. Lots of Features p
The phone was in the shape that I was told it was in. It was in great shape when I received it and it came with the original box and a charger. I was overall pleased with this purchase. p
I switched to this phone from a Samsung Android phone, and there is simply no comparison in the OS finish and fluidity, stability and ease of use, leaving Windows 7.5 leaps and bounds ahead of its competition. The Arrive's hardware/software integration is seamless, and on a par with any premium handset.Microsoft did a great job in partnering with HTC and ensuring the final product works effortlessly with all Microsoft/Windows software. HTC's fit and finish is once again only at a par with Apple's, but much more to my liking with metal and high grade plastics rather than glass all over, which in the iPhone always made me feel like I carried one of my mother's glass/porcelain figurines in my hand, afraid of breakage at every turn.Make no mistake, this is a business phone, and definitely the best of breed at that. The keyboard is excellent, and the total integration with Office, Skydrive, LinkedIn, Lync and multimedia/podcasting is astonishing. I have used a BlackBerry in the past also, and this single model defies the relevance of both BBOS and the design concepts RIM has brought to market with sliding keyboards in the past, with keys smaller than their regular keyboards. SMS and email integration is the bow on a perfect package for the business user, as well as a student, or any other user who values ease of use and extreme functionality.The HTC Arrive is a great bargain at this price, which is almost the same as one would pay for so many lesser devices today under contract. p
My son wanted nothing more than a smart phone for his 18th birthday. I was trying to find something reasonably priced and suitable for a teenager. I did not give him the choice of picking which phone he wanted. I did some research and settled on the Sprint HTC Arrive after reading several positive reviews. He loves this phone! He can access his XBox Live account and the 'People Hub' for contacts reads a lot like Facebook. p
Bad n
The phone wouldn't hook up to my line because it was jail token or something. Don't buy from them. n
I loved this phone. I upgraded because I wanted Windows 8 or I would still have it. p
The Touch screen was damaged.The external speakers were damaged as well. Understand what used entails but went beyond. it was beat up. This phone was trash on arrival n
Although the windows apps are a bit limited on this version, the phone is great for my needs and the tilted keyboard makes this an extremely fast and easy note taking and text writing device. The fact that the touch screen is also responsive also makes for a complete feel. Only draw backs are the inability to upgrade to windows 8, the camera is poor in low light and the screen size. p
I got this phone for 30$ shipped from cheapcellphonereplacement I am very satisfied with this phone but the back has a couple spots of worn down paint I am sending this review with this phone I love it haven't had much experiment yet with it but overall its 5 star except for the paint worn p
Amazon and the retailer did a fantastic job as they described, provided I get my refund when they receive the phone back to them. The phone itself is what I have a problem with. It would not allow incoming calls and Sprint could not connect it to data. I believe that the phone itself is outdated. I have placed a new order with Amazon and for obvious reasons I ordered a different phone. n
I am updating this, once again. My spouse's phone, which was working perfectly for the last couple of months bit the dust. It's completely useless, and there is no way to fix it. I was charging my phone by trading batteries, but it looks like both of us will have to get new phones at this point. One more thing that got increasingly irritating was the 160 character text limit. I would never recommend this to anyone - waaaay to many problems. -----------------Following are my previous posts:I am editing this review after chatting with a Sprint representative and resolving ALL of my phone issues (other than the battery not charging issue - hence 4 stars instead of 5, but I have a way to work around that problem).Although my issues were many, and it took several different chat sessions to get them all resolved, they were resolved, and I am now fully satisfied with this phone. Here is my previous review for reference. After seeing other (affordable) cell phones with horrible reviews, I found this phone and, even though there were a couple of bad reviews on this phone, they seemed isolated, so I assumed I would get a good phone. WRONG!! I guess it's a hit and miss though, because my spouse's phone has been great since the minute it was activated. My phone has been having problems since the minute I activated it. The Sprint store had a tough time activating it, and then once they got it through their system told me I could go home and it should work in half an hour - well, it never did connect, so I had to work with customer service the next morning to change something in my phone so it would work. I can't access the app store, most web-pages are very skewed and completely unusable, and to top things off it will not charge and is about to die :p I hate this phone right now. n
I went to the sprint store and they spent three hours trying to get the internet to work on this. Was able after an hour to get phone and text to work. I would have been better off paying the extra dollars and buying direct from sprint. n
the phone was complicated it wasn't what we has expected. I actually cancelled servie with my sprint an went elsewhere n
where too begin... thw HTC ARRIVE isnt all that. ive had this phone for about three weeks, i originally got the phone as a replacement for the s3. worst decision i ever made. the phone doesnt connect to the internet unless its wifi, and ive been on several calls with costumer care and gone into 3 different retail stores and none off them have been able too get it too connect to the carriers data.. its a pretty cool phone. their hasnt been an update on the phone for a while and the internet browser is like a 20010 browaer video quality sucks. i havent been able too download a single application on this phone. too get music you have to download zune on to youre pc... this phone is the most complicated phone i have ever had. best advices is not too get it. n
I've been using this phone over six months now. I really like having a keyboard to type on, rather than just a screen. I bought this phone after owning a Galaxy S2 for that reason. At first the screen tilt can be a little annoying, but I got used to it fast.\The Windows Phone OS is really streamline and works without any glitches. The only flaw is that the Microsoft app store is practically empty compared to the Android or iOS marketplaces. And as one who listens to a lot of Pandora radio, I was disappointed to learn that there is no official Pandora app for Windows phones, and there are no plans for one to be made. There are some 3rd party Pandora apps you can use, but they don't seem to work as well and crash a lot.Overall, good phone, good OS, nearly worthless app store. Hopefully now that the surface and Windows 8 are out people will start developing more apps for Windows devices, but if not, it will be back to Android for me. n
I absolutely love the phone! It is so fast and never gets bogged down no matter how many things I am doing at once. I had to usually clear all my conversations on my androids because they would load soooo slowly but with this phone I have my conversations going back for months and it is still just as fast as when I first got the phone. Battery life is normal. Turns on faster than any other phone I have ever seen. Takes about 10 seconds to start up. Over all this is a great phone. p
This phone came well packaged and the seller's description was spot-on. I have not found any defects after almost a month of service. Windows 8 is taking some time to get used to. There were a few settings (e.g. font size and an easier on/off system) on the Blackberry Curve I had, but this phone is out of the Blackberry's league.One problem is the redial or flash to call area at the top of the phone's screen. I kept hitting it with my ear and hanging up on people. Another is the placement of the volume button. Your hand/fingers support the phone right at that button while typing and using the camera (any landscape use).Overall I think this is a fine product. p
my wife loves this phone!she tells everybody about this phone,its to bad sprint doesnt make a windows *!!!!!!! great job p
Short learning curve. Battery life is about 8-10 hours.Great keyboard. Receives and sends text by voice in my car. Excellent screen. Good reception. Lots of Features p
The phone was in the shape that I was told it was in. It was in great shape when I received it and it came with the original box and a charger. I was overall pleased with this purchase. p
I switched to this phone from a Samsung Android phone, and there is simply no comparison in the OS finish and fluidity, stability and ease of use, leaving Windows 7.5 leaps and bounds ahead of its competition. The Arrive's hardware/software integration is seamless, and on a par with any premium handset.Microsoft did a great job in partnering with HTC and ensuring the final product works effortlessly with all Microsoft/Windows software. HTC's fit and finish is once again only at a par with Apple's, but much more to my liking with metal and high grade plastics rather than glass all over, which in the iPhone always made me feel like I carried one of my mother's glass/porcelain figurines in my hand, afraid of breakage at every turn.Make no mistake, this is a business phone, and definitely the best of breed at that.

Thanks p
I recenlty bought this phone and it works great. If I would be to reccomend it, I will definately do it! p
very cute and fast, thin but, this version is not expandible micro sd card p
I am not 100 percent happy about this smartphone. The reason is that instructions on how to open the case of such smartphone and how to insert an sd card were not included with the package. I only have instructions on how to insert a sim card. I still didn't managed to find how to do so. Thanks. p
This phone is very beautiful and windows phone 8 is a great OS. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a upper mid-range smart phone. p
I am unsure if the problems I experienced with this phone were due to general manufacturing defects, or if the seller I had purchased it from was unethically selling me a damaged phone at a normal retail price, without disclosing damage. Within a month of receiving it, the screen began freezing, requiring a manual reset approximately twice a day. Not happy. n
Runs so smoothly, I haven't had too many smart phones to compare properly, but it really is an amazing phone. I do things so much faster and I can multitask like crazy on this phone. Partly the windows system and partly b/c the phone is just great :) highly recommend, shipping was fast, all around good service. p
This is such an awesomeeeeee phone! Moves smoothly, Love the material of the battery cover because if your phone falls it bounces, camera is great, colour looks good. Many people ask about my phone p
The phone is great, considering that I switch from a BlackBerry is more than I expected for, really fast and beatiful screen, the operating system is like home. I love it. Buy it if you can. p
I bought this phone to replace my old Samsung Galaxy 2 which has ran its course... in comparison to this phone, I find the windows phone less user friendly by the placement of the buttons and the fact that compared in a Wi-Fi environment, the Samsung is always faster at alerting me a message has came in, as a matter of fact the HTC sometimes will not alert me at all that an email has arrived until I prompt it to refresh. the phone also seems to struggle with connecting to HTC store from time to time . All said and done... I've ordered a new phone, the LG G2... I hope to have better results n
nive but have not chance to change languaje, still nice phone, perfect for pictures and internet, we recomended HTC phone p
A great phone.. One of the best I've ever owned! WP8 is highly underrated in comparison to IOS and Android, but it is a great interface! p
I couldn't get the internet to work.I couldn't get any to really take my issue seriously and help me. p
Phone is comfortable to use,but somehow GPS programs were preinstaled for Australian location and no way to change it,so i downloaded side programs n
Its an awesome an it was the condition as the supplier described i am pleased p
Also got this one carrier said couldn't use this one. Dont know if its verizon or something else n
Wi-Fi hotshot doesn't work, says contact AT&T and we can't do that since it's unlocked with no active account. But, otherwise its great phone. Smooth, lightweight and slim. n
the best cel!! p
The hTC phone is good but the operating systems runs on Windows which I HATE. Most of the popular and commons apps that everybody has on android and iOS, are not available for the windows phone. They have a limited selection of games and the worst part is its NOT compatible with anything google. I have such a hard time using my google apps like gmail, chat, google voice, youtube, google search, google maps, weather app etcIf you try to do a search on google.com it will redirect me to bing.com and it will let you know that "this phone is not compatible with google". The worst is in terms of navigation, I cannot use google maps and the bing maps is horrible (I cannot tell you how many times I have gotten lost following bing directions)The camera is horrible and takes every photo with a sick yellow tint to it. It has beats audio which is great. The storage is only 16 gb which is very less (a few photos, videos and song will fill up the entire phone)I really like the way the phone looks, its a super sleek looking phone but everything about its functionality is horrible. I do not recommend this phone unless you want to waste your $$ on something that you are going to trash. n
I JULIE love it. It's an excellent for me. Please keep it up p
Power button can be a bit wiggly but this is a good windows phone. No 8.1 update or Cortana, but this phone is a good buy. p
Excellent product!!!! Super easy to use, excellent camera, big screen but small phone.. p
excellent phone, I love the design, super thin, thin side buttons, camera quality regular, nothing special, the operating system that has many things to improve, but that has nothing to do with the phone, but rather with windows 8, but if the cell is very good .. modern, design, price and the company really work very well for me to get the phone I wanted, elcelular work with most comapaÃ±ias inthe United States. p
I agree, but product version international bid, upon receiving notice that this led to Australia, I have no ability to select native Spanish language. would have a solution to this? p
Nice case and very protective of the HTC 8X windows phone. Quick shipping. Easy to use and great color for everyone. p
VERY GOOD CARE. I HAD A PROBLEM AND HELPED ME TO TIME.I WILL RECOMMEND. EXCELENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH p
Excellent phone. I bought one for my sister and everyone literally fights for it. No one wants to use their phone and is therefore asking for one as well. The only draw back is that I now have to either say no or get them all one. Thanks amazon for putting me in experience. LOL p
I love it... It kooks great. Apps, I found what I needed..My only regrets... It came wIth an Auatralian carrier(unlocked) but this limited the languages options to only English. The radio FM option was not present in this model. p
I was looking for something different so I went for a Windows phoneThe features (including Beats Audio) and the funky blue interface exceeded myexpectations. Despite apps that are generally not as developed astheir apple counterparts it more than does the job.Huge pleasure/aesthetic factor I don't understand why this phone wasnot a big p
I like the phone except that it is from Australia I found out after it arrived. It will not do everything a AT&T American phone will do n
I bought the phone for my wife and she was ecstatic . The sleekness and clarity is great . We will be buying more through your co. p
The phone is good, solid, and nice looking. The O.S is a different story though. Windows phone is horrible and stupid. Had to return it and ordered an Android phone the next day. n
great phone p
Amazing I love it and I go it like 5 days early p
A peace of junk n
Very satisfied about my order will get more stuff from Amazon p
It's is unlocked,but I can't do nothing on it just make a call,not even going to play store. p
i love it. htc 8x is excellent. p
This phone is fantastic everything work well with T-Mobile love it and would buy it again or refer a friend. SMS and MMS work great. Wish i had more storage but i kew that in advance so no problem. p
Doesnt work with some carriers, that use sim card as well n
Annoyed that can't send or receive photos, video, voice via text.Apparently something Verizon did to this phone makes it so you can send/receive that stuff.Also annoyed that there's not many apps available.Annoyed that I can't seem to bookmark on bing or google.And annoyed that there's no flashing light when I miss a call, text, etc.All the other stuff is good as advertised. n
This is a good phone but.....its shuts off on its own and I can't figure out why. Should we send this back??? n
excellent product , equipment in good condition . Thank you p
good p
Was for daughter she says she lives it just still getting use to it. She went from android to this phone. p
It's fantastic, Great Phone, just what I'm looking for, slim, comfortable and very fast... p
Great phone for the cost p
It was an amazing phone it was everything I had ever wanted. It worked wonderfully, I took very good care of this phone because of how nice it was. Then after owning it and using it for about 4 months it just died on me out of nowhere. There was no indication that the phone was going bad, nothing. It was working just fine. Before I knew it, it just wouldn't turn on. It just sits there not doing anything and I can't do anything about it. As you may not know this is an Internal phone, so you can not take the battery out as there is no battery cover. I feel helpless now because I used this phone for my job and now I can't get any of my information off of my phone. So basically I am screwed for the next month or so. Thank you HTC. n
The phone lit once.I trailed off, not volivio on. I do not recommend this store n
Great Phone. Unfortunately mines froze today and would not stop freezing. n
It described as like new but the screen has small scratches and the back too n
A+++ fast! p
This phone is very beautiful and windows phone 8 is a great OS. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a upper mid-range smart phone. p

The ChaCha is great... I knew what I wanted and this phone was perfect for me.. the QWERTY keyboard is nice big and spacy... The touch screen funcionalities are decent... With it 800GHz processador this phone is pretty decent and can handle anything as of now... I would only recommend this phone to ppl who like to txt, chat, of the like... Not a gamin phone at all... The down side which is a given or trade for the amazing QWERTY is the small size 2.4" screen i believe it is... However the pixels this small size screen contains is beyond imagination packs the same pixels as high end phones... Due to it being a white phone... I recomend this to a clean freak type of guy... As well... Or else get a case for it... The other down side is that due it supporting such impressive screen, 3G, all means of chat and social networks... Drains the batteryyy very very hastely... So b ware of it.. it is a given that it will need to b charged every night... But if u use it more than avg it might require some charging durin the day...As of the supplier.. it was excellent... Got it in the time frame no much hassle p
The packaged arrived new with box still sealed. Everything works perfectly and in good shape. i will recommend this phone to my female friends who love texting. The overall performance of the phone is great. p
It's the second day that I am using this phone. Till now it works as it was supposed to. Chacha is a nice phone with a great keyboard. It seems that its battery is not that reliable, but still it is my favorite phone for now. Chacha was my best choice to have android and keyboard together!:DIt works with non AT&T carrier but of course you can not use 3G just Edge connection.Using amazon prime it arrived in two days.And yes, 2GB micro SD was in the phone. p
Sirve perfectamente para cualquier operadora de Venezuela. No requiere de muchos pasos para que cumpla todas las funciones y es el mejor telÃ©fono haciendo una relaciÃ³n calidad/precio en marzo 2012. Por los momentos no le veo ningÃºn elemento negativo, a excepciÃ³n de la memoria interna que es algo baja y el consumo de baterÃ­a algo alto. AsÃ­ que recomiendo comprar una bateria extra. p
It is the best phone I have ever used. The touchscreen works great. The camera quality is great. The keyboard is great for texting. The battery does go dead fast, but it's worth it. p
I like the phone. I need the Qwerty keyboard because I have trouble with the onscreen ketboard. I thought ot would be compatible with T-Mobile 3G, but it's not. That's not the phone's fault though. The screen is a little small. p
I bought this phone because of my excitement of Android QWERT phone, but it ends when I received it and it was not working with my non AT&T Sim. I bought it beczus description says that it works with any sim which is not true. I will update my review if it will work with non AT&T sim. n
This is a basic smartphone. The apps are compatible with the android version of the phone, but the internal me memory is low so you can not install that many apps. You have 150 Mb of memory to install, but 30Mb or more are used by the phone and you can not uninstall those files.The resolution of the screen is pretty good and the touch system is very nice.The phone is fast, the keyboard is really easy to use and the camera is pretty good. The speaker is not so loud, but any way you use the phone with headphones(the phone does not include them,you don't use your phone to make a party.the phone has a frontal camera with normal resolution, but you can not use it for video calls, Skype does not work for video calls, and I haven't found an app to make video calls.Good investment if you want a Smartphone and you don't have the money for a Galaxy or something. n
I just received mine over the weekend, I am still amazed, what a Great phone this is. I highly recommend it to everyone it is the best smart phone I have ever used or seen. p
I have inserted my simple mobile sim card but the phone is asking me to enter 8 digit sim unlock pin. Called my Network provider but they could not figure it out can someone help or can the seller help me to do this. I need the seller to help me.This phone is great but it states that 810E series but the box says 810a. p
Great product with great service. I had a problem starting up the phone but the person selling it helped me within ten minutes of asking for help. p
Nice upgrade from my broken flip phone. Price was in my budget and shipping was fast. No complaints. p
Not the phone for me n
like it p
if you like none touch phones this is a good phone. worth buying NEW. it was for my wife and she kinda liked it.. she had no option either ha. p
Bought a refurbished one. The trackpoint was very unresponsive, no matter how I adjusted the sensitivity.The screen is rather small, so even having a Windows phone, most application are not very useable due to the small screen. n
I have just received my order and I was so excited to start using my phone. But much to my dismay and disappointment, the back cover was missing. At first I thought, "is it supposed to look like this???" but then again "surely NOT!!" Will be returning this product today. I hope to hear from the seller (UNLOCKED CELL PHONE KINGS INC.) soon and that they process my refund without delay. Will update this review depending on how well they respond to my problem... n
Even though the item I purchased was defective,they had no problem giving me a refund.I havent gotten it yet,but they said it wouldnt be a problem.For that,I will give them a good review,and say I would not hesitate to order from them again. p
This phone is pretty good. One plus is that it comes with windows mobile 6.5 rather than the 6.1 mentioned in the descrition box. When I purchased this item I thought I was going to have to upgrage to the 6.5 mobile software myself but that got scratched off my list. Camera works pretty well, but it is only a 2 MegaPixel camera. Video camera is also decent, does not lagg when I move the phone around. Windows office mobile is the same as always you can edit files for Word, Powerpoint, and Excel. Trackball is a little EHH, but some people like the trackball. Keys on the keyboard pop out making it easier to text. Wifi is a little dificult to connect at first but you will get the hang of it. I wish I could change the layout of the start menu but that is not do-able. Windows media player works good. If you do not like the headphones it comes with the box also comes with an adapter only downside of that is its not micro so it is kind of awkward. Windows marketplace has many apps available to download. I have not tested to see if it is truly unlocked but I will update this review when that is tested. Also if you have too many apps open you need to go to your task manager and end the application. If not it will SLOW down your phone because it is just like a PC it has a processor and certain amount of ram. If you just backspace the app it will not exit out and will just minimize. So every now and then check you task manager to make sure you do not have too many apps open and running. Overall it is a pretty decent phone and looks great. p
I decided to get a new phone after having my Motorola RAZR V8 for over three consecutive years, so I chose to get the HTC Dash 3G.Now keep in mind that this was my FIRST HTC phone, meaning I had no experience with this company's previous phones nor their customer service, but I decided to give them a shot.The phone looks very nice and the QWERTY keyboard was bigger than I expected. I immediately inserted my SIM Card and the battery, closed the back cover, and turned on the phone. Once turned on, I started to explore the phone a bit.The home screen was extremely well done, having separate categories for different things, i.e one category for missed or new calls, text messages, voice mails, and e-mails; another category for Windows Media Player and so on.You can also do all sorts of other neat things with this nice phone, such as set up to two alarms, check how many minutes or messages you have left via My Account, set or look for appointments, etc.The 2.0 megapixel was of no bother to me. This phone's camera was equivalent to my old phone's, except the Dash 3G had fixed focus, whereas my old one did not.I cannot comment on the Web browsing as my family's account only has Talk + Text.Overall, this phone was a satisfying purchase for $99.99 (at the time I bought it.) I would recommended it to anyone who loves to talk and text or is upgrading from a non-QWERTY keyboard phone to a QWERTY-keyboard one. p
The phone looks and feels very nice . It has many nice features but they are obstructed by the menu which is non-intuitive and not user friendly(to me anyway)Sending messages with video/audio/text is very easy and convenientCall quality is good, but I had many dropped calls (not sure was it network or the Dash itself.), Using speaker during a phone call, many people told me I sounded "choppy" or my voice varied in level; but I heard clear enoughSpeaker sound is a little tinny but not bad.Camera is just a "dash" below average-many pics were grainy, depending on lighting; likewise for video capture. Downloaded pics were more crispy, but got grainy with zooming in.Dealing with Windows Media Player is very very frustrating- cannot control files add/delete songs/videos; I could only play/stop/ full screen/ adjust volume-I couldn't access media files from inserted memory card, nor could I transfer them to the library (I am not a high tech guy so may be others will find that easy to handle).I used Wi-Fi (I don't have data plan); connectivity is not bad, but using the track ball is frustrating- movement was not precise; it is difficult to aim and click on something without hunting around it many times.Browsing speed was fast enough to me, but many times was hit and miss; the Dash will not allow me to type in (or get in) websites names directly; it only allowed search mode for them under Google-search, then I had to go through the search items , then hunt for the click spot, then click and click and wish it will connect!There is no refresh button( or at least I couldn't find it) once in a web page, and if a typo made in the website name there is no way to correct, but to go out and start again.The supplied head phones sounded OK, but little bulky and wouldn't stay in place.The head phone jack is awkward with its "huge" supplied adapter-I bought a smaller adapter but it didn't work with non-HTC head phones.When connected to the charger, the phone gets noticeably hot to touch- it is annoying that it will not tell you how much charge has accumulated, unless unpluggedI tried to get used to the Dash but couldn't and eventually decided to return it. In general I think it is a good phone for many people who can work with its features better than me.I hope this helps. n
The HTC Dash 3G is very easy to use and is great and very nice, the menus is must completly, and is very fast. p
excelente p
Ok had something else n
Good phone p
Cool phone for it's price p
The phone itself is very good. its well built and looks great. Performance is great. Battery life is average, lasts about a day on a normal to heavy use. My only issue with the phone is that it does not perform well T-Mobile 4G. You will not get 4g speed as the band is not supported. Also its a little pricey considering how old is this model. There are a lot of other models available in $300-$400 range which are only 6-12 month old and are far more superior.I would have given it a 3 stars but I am taking down one star due to incorrect description. Android 4.2.2 is not a Kitkat version, its still jellybean. I should have paid more attention before buying this phone. n
This phone drop signal overall it'sA good phone pretty slow some timeDoesn't worth the price tag its a Ok phone sound quality is good talk timeIs up to 6 hr i use it with. T-Mobile n
The smartphone is very superb and light which is very good for people that are looking for gadget that is not heavy. n
Good phone but will not hold a charge after having it a month that's what happened to me n
Low sound.. n
Beautiful! p
The phone is just as described and completely matches up to my expectation. Had to change the settings from CDMA to GSM for it to work with my SIM card but overall a very good purchase. p
good p
Bought this for my brother, he is utterly trilled with it. Only suprise for him was that he had to cut his SIM to the smaller format that this phone requires. Not a bad thing dough, he just didn't research it first. But other than that he is really glad with the feel look and performance of the phone. This is all I know for now. p
Hello I need the touch screen of this phone, I was a drop tube departed, help please p
I bought this devise few months ago and after using it for a while, there are few items that needs to be noted. This product is not as advertised. First of all this devise is not upgradable to 4.2.2 KitKat. I reviewed this in HTC website and no updates are available for this phone thus stating that this is upgradable to KitKat is a lie. Secondly, the devise does not support LTE. I live in New York City and LTE is fine in my area but this phone has never been on LTE. 4G does work. Another big disappointment is the Bluetooth in the phone is older version and will not be compatible with newer Bluetooth devises (i.e. my UP24 by Jawbone - fitness band).On Positive notes, phone looks good, best part about the phone is the sound quality. Processor is relatively fast but has been slowing down and lagging a bit.I had hoped that the upgrade would be available and did not know about the Bluetooth being of older version so I kept the devise past the return period. I am just waiting to switch the phone... n
outstanding mobile phone with good display quality at a reasonable price. However the one I got wasn't unlocked, so I have to turn it back. p
so good p
I'm use this phone on AT&T. It's working very good! p
Great phone. for great price and right on time p
This is not good work with bluetoothI m not satisfied with HTC deluxe butterfly n
Fast, as described, but no owners manual. p
Nicely built phone, nice specs, great price. However, it is NOT upgrade-able to Android KitKat as advertised here, and it suffers due to its extremely outdated software (HTC Sense 4+).Most likely, it WON'T work with LTE but it definitely works with T-Mobile regardless of what other reviews had said. Simply change your mode to Global or GSM and it will get pretty decent 3G speeds in T-Mobile.My biggest drawback is the obscurity of the model. Most people have never heard of this specific version (it is not exactly a HTC DNA nor Butterfly), and therefore, it didn't get the updates that the other versions got (Android 4.4). it's also impossible to find adequate ROMs if you wish to root it in order to update its software.Basically, is a phone with nice hardware that regrettably got stuck and forgotten with outdated software. Also: the screen is pretty impressive, but it has a horrible battery life. n
Phone was not unlocked! n
it didn't work and it wasn't the phone that i ordered n
Really like this phone!I had to change settings (to GSM) to make my Straight Talk Sim card work, and now everything is great! p
This is Verizon version and even though is unlocked but you should go to setting and change the CDMA to GSM in order that phone can recognize the sim card and what ever i did to make the phone send or receive the MMS didn't work and it would not let you set up the APN and also it doesn't update the software and software stay's on 4.1.1, so I decided to send the phone back. n
This phone can't work with my T-Mobile SIM card (It can't recognize the T-Mobile SIM), and there is no headphones in the box. n
Just got my HTC butterfly..Put in my T mobile sim...guess what..its doesnt recognize it...The seller doesnt have phone number or an email id...spent hours talking to t mobile....HTC and even tried unlocking the phone...I am going to return this piece of sh** n
The best phone I've ever use. I love the smooth touch and the excellent picture quality. Thumbs up for HTC Deluxe. p
I love this phone! Easy to use and great battery life. p
buenicimo p
Awesome. Love it p
good p
exelent p
Very good p
No manual came with it. It didn't upgrade to 4.2 kit kat. I am not happy with this phone. It is nice phone. It look like box been open but it another label seal over original label. n
very very nice phone love it p
No extra micro SD card slot for expanding memory.. No 4G LTE on T-Mobile or GSM in USA ... n
This phone is not worth buying at all! False information on this product I've tried putting sim cards in from numerous carriers none of them worked . very unsatisfied would appreciate refund or new phone that is actually unlocked. Would give a zero if I could n
Ive had my phone now for a few days and it is very impressive. It's sleek and attractive and worked great outof the box. I am with Cricket Wireless who is owned bt AT&T. I put my GSM SIM card in from AT&T and the phone is workinv flawlessly. it boast a huge 5in screen and the colors are superb. This is NOT the HTC Butterfly...so dont expect the same features and upgrades. The BEATS audio is killer!!! I use my phone while im working out at the gym...Planet Fitness of course, all you hear is the music. It seems to be a good phone for the price point. p
I just use this cellphone by 8 months and IT LOOSE THE UNLOCK CODE. Now i cant use it! Fail. I loose my money n
Got it for my teen son. Does not function well, does not connect to net properly like our iphone do. Broke rather easily. n
good product p
Exelente!! p
Working well with Vodafone & Airtel service in india my wife love it. p
very good p
It looks like this is a common bug this phone has. I have tried to do some reasearch to fix it myself still without any luck. If the GPS werent as important as it is for me, I would five it five stars. n
Great buy p
Excellent p
Don't buy it... my cell data doesn't work n
Sometimes it freezes and I have to reboot it by holding down the power button p
Worst phone ever. Beats only works with headphones, cover for the charger port broke off within a week, and out of nowhere, nothing happened to it and it shuts itself off, and is not charging, will not turn on. Will not be buying another HTC. Definitely making the switch to iPhone. n
Very nice phone, they shipped very fast p
No micro sd memory port in this phone is a bad thing. n
I put my carrier sim and not work it, I have take it to technician for true unlock it n
It is a great phone! No complaints. p
The cell phone is good. But it works for 3G only and does not work for 4G. p
i really love this phone, but it give problem now. I bought it since 8 months, now it can not take charge. p
Absolutely in love with this phone. It just keeps getting better the more I personalize it. Love it!! Seriously, the phone is glossy, HD screen, pictures are exquisite. I am sold! I really hope I encounter no problems because am in love. The internet signal took a while to start flowing, but when it got going, wow!This is a really good product from HTC. Thank you. I'm picky and hard to please and this did. Not a lover of built in batteries and no port for external memory, but doesn't even matter, I have 11 GB from the 15 provided to us.I am good. No I am great!! p
first off i would like to say this phone is AMAZING!!, its fast and smooth, the display is amazing, the design is almost flawless, big screen but skinny so it fits in the hand. it is unlocked, it has options like to use a gsm/umts or lte/cdma, the battery life is great. its a amzing piece of texh that anybody would be happy with and for just a little over 190 bucks it definitely worth it!! p
It's very fast and stable, and has an acceptable camera. The Android interface doesn't look very well and doesn't have good widgets, like the good status bar on the top with controls like Samsung phones. Also doesn't have FM radio. p
It was listed as an unlock phone but it wasn't I had to get it unlock. False advertisment n
THE BEST SELLER p
It's a beautiful phone but have yet to get it to activate, I read where it might be setting it to GSM may be the answer but even that I have been unable to do. p
Very nice sound and screen definition. The battery life is very good.Picture quality is regular. p
Very happy p
I have bought this phone for my wife and she is so happy. She is using it in Cabinda Angola. Great purchase. p
Exellent!!! p
GREAT p
This IS NOT a Verizon phone. Never worked right after I finally got it activated. If you have Verizon stay away. Look for the HTC DNA instead. n
its very bad , i am not able to find the network for most of the cases n
The phone was a great buy. My daughter love it. p
Great phone, beautiful! p
Excelente.. p
Very decent phone for $199. However, it won't get Lollipop. p
ok p
great phone great product love it p
this is a nice phone. i am just disappointed that i can not get it acctivated. it is not unlocked. will not read any sim cards. so i have no choice but to return it. n
sent it back because it wouldn't work on verizon! took it to a verizon store and they said it wpold not work not one of their phones!! n
Awesome phone. Just have a question. Can I update my software to 4.1.2 without any problems? p
Very nice phone p
Best phone I've ever had. Even though it's an old model i find the screen resolution, the camera and the sound on the phone amazing. The build is great it feels like a really solid phone, it is slim and the material used for the rear panel is very nice it gives you some grip to prevent it from slipping out of your hand. It can not be updated to the most recent version of android but i honestly do not care as long as the operating system is stable. The UI is nice as well. Many people complain about it not having a removable battery but to be honest all my other phones had removable batteries and not once did I buy a second battery so it really doesn't affect me. They also complain about it not having external memory capabilities but again the 11 gbs it comes with is enough for me. p
perfect!!! p
I wrote a review earlier and praised this phone for being great but I'm sadden to find out it's not actually factory unlocked as it was said. So buyers out there should know U will have to pay an extra to unlock it otherwise it's not worth buying. I'll suggest buying one that's truly unlocked. I'm gonna return this!!! n
Excellent phone, high resolution, best video and more things, but doesnt work on digitel with H+ only movistar and movilnet. p
Great phone for the price! You can't mount an SD card but the 2 gigs of RAM and fast processor make up for this. Also the screen size dwarfs almost every apple product on the market. p
Very nice phone, too bad for me the Amazon send me this phone is not an unlocked device, I have install 2 active SIM cards from AT&T and T-mobile were not recognize by registry. Then I could not get the wireless service at all. p
Not what I expected eked well for a while then stared to mal function n
My voice on the phone of my friends with whom I speak is heard too low (I'm not covering the microphone) n
I LOVE THIS PHONE p
This is product is said UNLOCKED. but actually its not I tried with couple of GSM service provider and its not accepting them .Its locked. I wasted my money . be alert . dont buy this.. n
VA12I can only speak to the experience of just TRYING DS CCF n
Love the look of this phone. Really slim and sleek with a nice rubber back and awesome screen. You have to change your mobile data settings to GSM. Also if you have problems with your data, you have to call your cell phone provider and get things set up with your sim card and such. I was able to make phone calls/text but I was unable to use data. I could only use data with wifi, but not when I was on the road. Took an hour in a chat room with customer service but after that things worked. p
ok p
Incredible p
Great! Nice phone and very helpfully p
Good phone p
I bought this HTC Butterfly as announced but turned out to be HTC Deluxe - which is a different model with different specs. Please be cautious and better avoid it. HTC Butterfly should have an SD Card slot and should be water-splash resistant, But this one is not! This is just an unlocked version of HTC Droid DNA - but but not Butterfly. n
Good phone. Works with tmobile but only gets 3g. Apparently, it does receive 4G but only with Verizon. I felt a little cheated on since i thought i would be able to get 4g with any carrier, but my dad likes the phone. n
Nice phone. Shipping was a little slow. p
I bougth this phone last year and at least 3 times a day the phone is reset alone, then it starts again and again running normally until it fails again. Every day the same malfunction. The device emits a fault report, I sent this but I don't received feedback. To whom can I call or send an email to solve this malfunction. n
I expected to arrive with headphones but there everything ok. p
I love my HTCs. The only problem I have encountered with the ones I have owned is that the speaker phone is very faint. Also lately, noticed I could no longer send picture messages. p
This product worked very good for 6 months and start giving problems after that/ Now the screen is blinking on edges all of a suddent. Restarted mutiple times but no use. Still having the same issue. n
This is butterfly p
excellent p
Better than I expect!! p
I love it p
in love with it. great phone p
Excellent p
Good for music, but not durable at all. 2nd week of owning it, took a 3 foot fall and shattered the glass. No one makes a replacement screen for this specific phone so now I'm back to a shattered phone again n
really nice p
Good p
Can't get picture/sms messages on T mobile network. Have to try another carrier. n
Great phone have no problems p
good commend him p
Very Nice p
I love this phone, great value for money p
It Is a incredible Machine. Averthing as expected p
Excellent article. It is the awaited thing! 100 % Recommended p
this phone did nit work well with my net10 carrier. n
Excelente telefono p
perfect, the cellphone run really well p
Was told this would work with AT&T network... some features work but one that does not is picture messaging. I spent a lot of time on the phone with AT&T trying to fix it and was told that because it is not an AT&T phone that there is nothing they can do about it. May end up returning it. n
I originally bought it as a gift for my wife but now I'm seriously thinking if keeping it. I love the phone, lots of great apps, it's fast and good battery life. The seller was great, phone arrived on time and was just as discribe by the seller. p
Muy Bueno p
Beautiful phone but when i tried connecting it to a phone company they told me it was reported stolen. Im returning this phone. n
sceen wasnt working n
very slow and battery drains quickly, not satisfactory... n
Nice phone, works pretty well n
I broke my verizon DNA. This was the replacement for it. it's supposed to be to same phone. this phone is considerably slower,reception is terrible some of the default sounds cannot be turned off. I hear a notification sound and it will take a full minute before the email is available andthere is no notification in the little bar on the top. All in all I'm very disappointed with the phone n
We bought two of these. I'm never signing a phone contract again. We broke that vicious circle by providing our own unlocked phones and going with a GSM network for service. I feel unshackled! Although the phone can be tethered...It's a beautiful piece of technology, smooth feel, large screen, fast as heck, and several features that are very handy.******I am three and a half months into using this phone and having major problems with it. Several factory resets didn't fix it. Took it to the service provider to check the sim card. Sim card is AOK. The mother board in the phone has failed. Called HTC. Big run around there. Bottom line: HTC will not honor the warranty on this phone. They said it was a used phone because I bought it from Amazon. After Ia few choice words, I hung up with them and called Amazon. Cudos to Amazon!!!! Amazon will honor the warranty.I will never buy another HTC product in my life. Those are really smarmy business tactics. Shame on HTC. p
Its a good phone but it doesn't let me use my mobile data it only works on wifi ! n
Excellent p
Package Properly , Works Good , Brand New !! Love IT p
It did not work as 4g lte only 3g n
How to update the phone Android to version 4.2.2 Kit Kat. as you describe in the publication. I need you help me pleases. n
I love this phone! It has all the features that I was looking for. The performance and resolution are amazing! It is exactly as It looks in the pictures above. I love it! p
The phone was what i wanted but i couldnt get it on straight and thats why im sending it back. p
Very very good p
The phone is just as described and completely matches up to my expectation. Had to change the settings from CDMA to GSM for it to work with my SIM card but overall a very good purchase. p
good p
Bought this for my brother, he is utterly trilled with it. Only suprise for him was that he had to cut his SIM to the smaller format that this phone requires. Not a bad thing dough, he just didn't research it first. But other than that he is really glad with the feel look and performance of the phone. This is all I know for now. p

outstanding mobile phone with good display quality at a reasonable price. However the one I got wasn't unlocked, so I have to turn it back. p

Great phone. for great price and right on time p
This is not good work with bluetoothI m not satisfied with HTC deluxe butterfly n
cell too small n
Everything is good except the back cover.very poor thin plastic n
Perfecto p
I love it p
Great phone for this price ! p
The size is okay but the battery in the phone get hot too quick when you are on the phone for a while p
very very bad, touch is not working ,i bought it just 1 1/2 month back,very very bad experience n
Battery over heats n
It broke down in nine months n
GOOD p
Good old device. p
Phone stopped working or charging after 2 weeks. I changed battery charger and it wouldn't work. I used charger on another phone and it worked. So, not charger problem. Phone will not charge. What can I do? Can I get a refund? This is disappointing. I will not buy phone from Amazon again. It's better to go to local stores where you can have direct access. n
Excelente product, as described. Very happy with it. Very fast in the delivery. p
Good morning,Yesterday I finally got my phone because I live in Venezuela, and my daughter in law lives in another city, the thing is that I received another phone, that is ok because is almost the same type of phone, But I let you know that you have to be more carefull about these stuff, you might lose a lot of money or your customer could be dissapointed. n
Love this phone,for the price you can't beat it.my only concern is that the battery is not removable. p
What you see is what you get. p
i wish i had done more research because the phone does not switch to sprint otherwise the phone was perfect! p
works really good, just would like it has more capacity p
Excellent phone!! It took a while to get it but let me tell you that it was a great purchase. Easy to operate, speakers in the right place with full functionality. I recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade! p
Supposed to be "unlocked" it is semi unlocked. You can use yo call and text but you cannot use data on it... Took it to Tmobile and they cant fix it n
My first smart phone. So needed a easy transition. This one is just that. Easy to use and gets you into all the apps and smart phone gadgets. Installing apps was a breeze. Not too big in the pocket. So for the price its a great phone. p
Excellent product p
I don't know how the phone works because so far we can't even turn it on. The instructions that came with the phone are not accurate at all. For example, the instructions say to remove the back with your finger.Ha! That is a joke! It is nt humanly possible to take the back of the phone off without a sharp tool. Next the instructions tell us to remove the battery and install the SD card underneath. A) the battery isn't removable and B) there is no place underneath to install an SD card. So after almost ruining the phone due to bad instructions we find a place to install SIM amd SD on the side. Ugh! n
This was my second HTC Desire 610 phone I drop my first one about 30ft high but I have to say this is a nice phone for the price! p
Disappointed this phone had no sim card..trying to find one so we can use the phone ... n
Awesome phone. p
Nice product p
scam !!! this s*** isnt unlocked do not buy ! this is my third purchase and the first two came as locked which I CLEARLY KNEW however when the discription on the phone says """"HTC Desire 610 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE.......and it came as a locked phone i belive this is some down right $^*( ------ disappointednot recomended n
I received this phone on Thursday, since then it freezes and restarts. It's very frustrating. n
This is a more affordable smart-phone for those that do not need their phone to be their personal computer. The phone works great, and the battery life is very good. The screen size and specs are adequate for basic browsing. If you just need a phone to be a phone, this is a great option. We use this with trac-fone prepaid plans, as we do not have need for large amounts of data transfer or minutes per month, which makes it a very affordable option for smartphone use. p
Working perfectly. Thanks p
Nice phone p
The battery is draining very fast. p
Item as described - should be a wonderful Christmas for my step-daughter p
I bought this phone in order to use it on the t-mobile network, however, the Sim size of the phone is a Nano while I had a micro Sim card. After some cuts on my micro Sim card, I was able to make it work perfectly. Also, in order to get data connection for t-mobile you need to insert a network manually, there's several videos on youtube that show step by step how to do it. Other than that, the phone has worked perfectly and the packaging was perfect as well. p
Very good!!! I recomended! p
Screen scratches easily. n
Had to return it because the APN wouldn't work with Walmart Family Mobile n
excelent p
I like my HTC desire , it's definitely better then my Windows phone I had, my phone was clean nd fresh, thz. n
EXCELLENT p
Awesome phone for the price. Consumer reviews weren't terribly kind, but they're comparing the 610 to flagship models. I'm glad I got this phone, and the customer service has been outstanding. p
It's an okay phone n
I bought this as a gift and she liked it very much. p
Excellent phone. Great sound, and with a great display screen. Which is much larger then I expected, but is also a great thing.. U might want to think about buying a case for it because of the slimness of the phone. p
I bought this phone last week and in India now. I jot able to use it with any and m card . its asking for unlock code. Pla help me n
It was broken when I got it n
The phone is locked! the title is misleading.its written unlock phone but the phone is actually locked to AT&T networkbig disappointment! n
Got it for my daughter and she loves the phone. The only thing is, she said the battery looks used! p
excellent product, the purchase is made as agreed, recommended selle p
great phone beautiful pictures p
Works mint. Thank You. p
The hotspot is blocked. You can not share internet from my mobile phone n
Nice phone I love it. p
Took awhile to get accustomed to touch screen phone but this phone complys with all the extensive reviews already on site. I keep it simple for my needs but the phone can perform as well as any high priced phones out there. Would reccomend. p
one of the best phones I've owned. Great sound, photos a good quality, options are endless p
Perfect p
I love it p
I would have given a five star if it was exactly how it is advertised. The fact is, it is an AT&T phone which is factory unlocked. What that means is you can't really get all its features if you don't use AT&T - I used it with T Mobile and even though voice and data worked okay, it was never possible to tether it as a mobile hotspot and use the data. This makes the phone pretty useless for me. I'm kind of forced to use AT&T - which I don't like and possibly wouldn't have bought if that was mentioned clearly. n
The phone is good p
Good phone. No complaints so far. Could easily be a five p
Bad n
This phone didn't work. Wouldn't read SIM card. The reader wasn't working. Big disappointment. n
Bought it. followed every direction. Verified it would wok with my phone service. Set it all up, got a nano-sim card from my service provider. Called customer service to have put on line. After 2 days of trying, I find out the phone is not unlocked. Amazon is the distributor. Have not figured out next plan of action. If I have to eat it I will spend eternity taking action. I spent months searching, researching, learning about phones. It's what they don't tell you that messes up your day. We don't really have a choice of being in the computer / web / phone world. No body really know WTF works with what. they say it does, but, they have not tested it. All theoretic BS. Its not the phone, its those lying about its functionality. I have never been vindictive in my life. I will not let this go. Have had enough. I have all the documentation. Wonder what courts can do for misrepresentation. n
works well p
Great phone, works like a charm, it is fast, intuitive and easy to use, great camera!! p
Working properly as soon as I installed my sim card p
This phone didn't work. Wouldn't read SIM card. Called for assistance, went to AT&T store another SIM card. Told reader wasn't working. Big disappointment. n
I've had this phone for about a week now, and so far I love it! My only complaint would be the battery life. If you're not on it it lasts for a long time but if you want to text, play games, scroll Facebook, or whatever it loses percentage very quickly. p
I love this phone. The price is reasonable and the phone is great. Also, the delivery time was exceptional p
Great product and easy to use. p
Saved $100 off in store pricing. Thank you so much. p
Exceeded expectations. p
Great phone love it. It have great features the feel of the phone is nice and sleek. The cameras are great, the performance is fast and responds quickly, the screen is nice as well. Despite all the negative feedback and reviews I really love and it a great phone the best. p
Excellent p
perfect but the camera sucked p
I've never given a one-star rating before now, but I don't see any reason the phone should cost more than $30. Poor quality, touch is bad, phone is slow, screen is like black and white (no colour), camera is poor. Only good things about the phone are: Sound and cell signal OK. n
Phone came damaged, all covered in liquid from the battery.. Now i can not return it beacuse UPS cannot transport equipments with damaged batteries, the lithium is classified as hazadous material. I do not recommend it , nor buy anything refurbished.. n
Its not working for T-Mobile. n
satisfied p
The description said the phone was unlocked but the phone was actually locked. I sent the phone to different country abd now have tonpay extra to unlock it. SIM card did not work. n
Works great thank you p
After one used the phone doesn't workAm so disappointed n
Got this for my uncle, after using it for about half a year, the wifi function no longer works. Tried resetting, etc, and none of it worked. Finally took it into AT&T customer service center and see if they know of other tricks to get the wifi going again.The guy looked up the phone info, and found out the phone was previously sold in 2014, and what I bought was actually a refurbished phone. n
great phone, unlocked it for tmobilethere were some settings that had to be tweaked to receive pic messages thounder settings > APNcontact your provider to get the correct entrieskinda wish the blacklight was a little stronger, but whatever its great otherwise p
look like new with box and charger p
Good p
I've had this phone almost 2 weeks now, and I'm very happy with it so far. It has a good-sized screen, with decent resolution.I'm on AT&T Go-phone, which is what the phone was originally meant for.....I also wanted to use it abroad on my UK sim card....but as the sim card it takes is nano-sized, it won't fit my 'abroad' micro-sim.No big deal....I've got another phone for abroad anyway... and I don't use data when I'm away from the US.My old phone was also micro-sim....but I went into my local AT&T store.... and they swapped my micro sim for a nano.The phone itself has every feature I need.....the camera takes better pictures than my 'proper' camera....Battery life is pretty good....I can get 2-3 days on a charge.My niece has an IPhone.....my HTC does everything her far-more-expensive IPhone does,If you've got a micro sim and can't change it for a nano, it might not be the phone for you.....that's the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. p
It works on t-mobile and it's better than I thought. p
I was taking back that the phone doesn't use a regular Sim but a nano Sim which had to be inserted in the side of the phone that was a deal breaker for me cause I had gotten the phone for a family member overseas n
Works fine for my son. We wanted to have phones separate from contracts, and this phone works well with LTE service on AT&T (and will hopefully also work on other carriers in certain other countries.) p
my son loves this phone hooked right upwith straight talk great price too p
I had use the phone for a week. Strong signal, easy to use and navigate, right size, looks great, battery is holding 2 full days. So far I found just one issue: the calculator is really poor, it needs a serious update. The basic camera is average; however, if you play with the setting you will see a serious improvement. The construction is plastic, so I recommend a case. Compared to newer phones it looks just OK but the size and functions are above average.UpdateAfter few months, this is a great phone for the price. p
I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law whose old phone was about five years out of date. She finds it very easy to use and was able to get it set up with her original Cricket phone number in minutes at the store. p
Battery died within 3 months n
Great product p
he telephone does not work. HTC Desire 610 8GB Unlocked GSM Quad - Core LTE 4G Android 4.4 Smartphone - BlackSold by : Shari International Inc. I want my money back . Thank you. n
it is not worked real 4g lte it is only write on the screen n
This phone is pretty good. It met my expectations: good screen, good space to install Apps (approximately 4GB), it is fast, good sound and good camera. I do not give 5 starts because, although effectively this phone is unlocked for telephone operators, has a lock to level "Mobile Hotspot" because not allowed, to use this function, and according to what you find is, apparently, caused by AT&T. p
The phone is blocked on At&t and I've not been able to use my t mobile card. it looks used. It's very annoying. Bought a second one from another seller with the same issue. Don't buy this product! n
Because it's unlocked it's an old AT&T phone my company is T-Mobile n
Would have been five stars, but the battery life is rather awful. The processor speed is pretty slow and can get bogged down pretty easily. Just having snapchat up can kill the processor. n
Just as expected ! p
Item was returned. DOA. Would not turn on. n
It s refurbished. No headphones and memory. n
I MOSTLY LIKE THIS PHONE SO FAR. I WISH I COULD DELETE SOME OF THE APPS THAT I REALLY DON'T WANT. ALSO CONSTANTLYHAVE TO UPDATE THE APPS WHICH GETS VERY IRRITATING p
Love the phone...HTC is great p
The phone is very good , takes very sharp pictures but the screen is not bright n
The phone was a great deal, wife loves it p
was a LOCKED phone. I needed a UNLOCKED Phone Sending it back. Robert Moen.To send a locked phone when it was described to be UNLOCKED is very poor.Also it was set to spanish. WE wasted over 12 hours, plus 2 hours of time of Consumer cellular person in wasted effort to get a locked phone to work. I am disgusted with such a stupid mistake as this was.Robert F. Moen n
Excellent phone, Only minor issue is getting back cover off, very flimsy and can break easily p
Nice phone, was a present for my wife!!! p
Omg I just love this phone. I bought it because my work phone its just crap. This moves just like my personal iPhone. p
Good phone for the price n
excelent smart phone, i recomend this product and seller p
For the price great, but has some minor issues and bugs but nothing major. n
Poor n
very good phone love all the features it has p
Love it... p
Headfone is not so good p
This is a great phone, I bought it used like new, and it seemed to be in perfect condition upon arrival. People have commented about the screen not being very high resolution, but the image and video quality has seemed quite satisfactory to me. The android user interface is very easy to navigate, and the structure and layout of the physical device seems solid and well thought out. p
I used the phone in India.Right size to carry around and needed no alterations.Excellent reception,and clear sound.Used for a month and quite happy with it. p
Pretty decent phone for the price p
The best phone i ever had. p
So far so good. p
This wasn't a unlocked phone and I'm so upset right now n
Beware of missing information. I was looking forward to my first Android phone and what I received was a big disappointment.1. The write up about the HTC was very interesting at the capabilities. The memory cards being on the outside of the phone was not something I would prefer but I thought I could work with that.2. I kept reading and found that the battery is not user friendly, hidden away in a sealed compartment. The phone does not have a replaceable battery but I thought I could work with that.3. The memory cards; (this is from the HTC manual that I finally found after several hours of searching the web) "Open the plastic slot cover with your thumb or finger insert nano SIM card until it clicks." There is no click and no sound or feeling a click. Same story for the microSD card. But one thing more, never heard of doing this, "Unmount the microSD card". "Slide the plastic hinge into the side and press the cover until it clicks into place." A hinge folds or swings, it does not slide. It is on a very thin plastic hinge so it folds over the slot. I could see that breaking off very soon.4. The working phone itself is not bad, a little confusing, but not bad. I had been reading the manual before the phone came but it is not one I would have written because it leaves out information (I have written several manuals during my engineering career). No mention of the memory card sizes through out the manual. Does give a decent job of how to put the cards into the phone with pictures included. The software is similar to Windows 8.1 phone, which I have, with the sliding screens only they call them "widget panels". I did not get into them but to know that the phone comes with two and you can set up others.5. Interesting stuff: Transferring your old information was easy and painless until I went to find it. Google Drive integration. This phone is all about Google. On the home page is an icon that is GOOGLE. You press it and you go into the Google app store. The HTC phone is all about using "Two-finger swipe" and "Three-finger swipe", "makes the three-finger gesture work only" is from the manual. I rarely use my fingers, my fingers are too oily puts a film on the screen. I use a stylus with a rubber tip and did not have any problems working the apps or switching between panels. I take screen caps on my Windows Phone and wondered it the HTC does too. I did not find it until now. The process is similar, "Press and hold POWER and VOLUME DOWN at the same time".6. Now the bad stuff. I would give this a "minus ONE STAR" IF I COULD. The HTC did not come with the nano-SIM card. The phone can not be ATT activated with out the nano-SIM card. I sent an email to the seller, requesting the nano-SIM card. They told me, "if you look at the listing, "'it says it does not come with a sim card'". I did, four times, and there is no mention of any sim card, including or not including the card in the package. After telling them that then they said, "if it does not mention the sim-card it will not come".That is to say if the seller does not say, "the HTC does not include the memory (nano/SD) cards" then they will not be part of the shipment. The power cord is not mentioned either but that is included.The HTC phone has a label on the back that has the IMEI numbers and a note from ATT that says, ""Current AT&T customers:" and above the IMEI label it says, "new SIM included in the package". The saving grace of this is that I went to the ATT site and put in the IMEI number and ATT would send me a nano sim, Free, to activate the phone. That would have been ok except I paid for the nano sim card that every phone comes with, my Windows Phone did and I activated it in two hours. The individual was arguing through the email about not sending out the card.You wasting time and money if you buy this phone because of the sim card. n
Fairly easy for my mother to use as her first smartphone. p
Great n
Simply the best phone I ever had, way better than Samsung S4 (I9500) I must say...... Evendough it does't have killer specs, it really doesn't need it, its performance is amazing, battery life is out of this world, with all running, it lasts up to 36 hours, I'm talking about WIFI on and updating packages frequently, if I turn WIFI off, can easily last 48 hours....... Watching movies and videos every once in a while between charges, it can lasts at least 24 hours..... p
This is the best phone for the money. Recorded stereo sound is excellent quality. And the whole interface is much less of a pain than either iPhone or Samsung. I think the only reason not to buy this phone is the camera: it only shoots HD 1080p, not UHD 4K, and does a mediocre job at that. But if you don't need awesome video or camera quality, it's a solid buy. p
Phone came defective, I had to return it for replacement. n
It's a very nice phone and a reasonable time dated.To bad it's gsm instead of CDMA p
Phone in general is good. But wont be satisfied with camera.Camera 2.5/5Phone 4/5 for the price. n
Verry. GoodðŸ‘ p
Phone works well. p
Very Good, just what I wanted!!! p
Works excellent. p
Wife loves it. p
exelente p
Good for the price i bought it used for 97 dlls p
good phone, good transaction p
Ours came broken. After investing in a new sim card the thing would not charge. It is being returned. Ruined birthday for my daughter plus added expense. Very unhappy. n
works well p
I bought this cell but never could use it, I live in dominican republic and tried many sim cards including AT&T sim card and it doesn't work n
It is a good device for the price n
Excellent buy... p
Thanks for the product, it is very good and working superbly p
Great purchase. Very happy! p
So far, so good. p
Great p
You cannot send MMS while you are listening music.Device will freeze and restart ((( What a waste.By the way device is not factory unlocked,but unlocked from AT&T ((( n
Very disappointed. I purchased an unlocked phone but after traveling to another country and giving the phone as a gift I find out it is a ATT phone and is locked, not as it was described. I had to bring phone back and family member was without Christmas gift. n
Is a great cell phone p
Phone was advertised as gsm unlocked but it only works with AT&T n
I bought three phones as per the title it says unlocked but When I try into insert lycamobile it says locked very disappointed. Sent an email to the sender (breed) will update my comments basing on the reply. n
This phone was released after my old HTC One S (2012), and it looks much, much more dated, both the form factor and the UI. I was very puzzled. On the other hand, it's durable because of the plastic casing and easy to use for the most part. The call quality is okay, the battery is not as long-lasting as the higher end phones. n
Came undamaged and in a timely manner. Liked it enough that we bought another one for both me and my husband! p
Excellent p
Excelent very good People p
Disappointed this phone had no sim card..trying to find one so we can use the phone ... n
Best phone I've had so far p
cell is bad and bought more! .... buy a new phone and a phone with me mandaro manufacturing defects and fully inoperative! upon receiving the cell makes a formal complaint ..... and it did not proceed! the phone is totally inoperative ... (I not recommend the nadien) n
defective n
Bought this for my fiance..he loves it! Fits perfect in his pocket which is a big thing for him. Takes nice pictures and sound is really good! â˜º p
Love my phone, does everything, big screen, fast and very complete p
The mic doesn't work and the touchscreen is not receptive at all. This is junk. n
Bought phone as present for a relation in Africa and after 3 days of use broke down. Spent extra to have it fixed since it will cost more to have it returned n
Good quality p
Really nice I like the phone it actually served the purpose for which I bought it p
VERY WELL p
Had it for a few months now, Living in Trinidad and it works good p
Very good p
Not unlocked n
Nice phone. Battery life would be better. p
For some reason this phone isnt compatible with antutu benchmark 3d. n
as described p
Excelent cell phone. The best value for money p
This is being FALSELY advertised as an unlocked phone. These are LOCKED to ATT. Do not buy if you need an actual unlocked phone. n
Excellent price and it works perfect p
Took awhile to get accustomed to touch screen phone but this phone complys with all the extensive reviews already on site. I keep it simple for my needs but the phone can perform as well as any high priced phones out there. Would reccomend. p
had it now for over a year and it works better than my Samsung did after a year p
Ok , nothing but ordinary. n
My Grand daughter loved it so much she traded it in for another model. lol.. er behind my back p
Phone WAS NOT NEW AS DESCRIBED Refurbished.Won't update as it says it's a test phone. Not happy at all. n
Excellent smartphone. It has been a year I bought it and is perfect p
Garbage n
I had this phone be4 n love it..now those pics so liquid all over box n phone....i swear ppl r dum... any kind of batteries will not do that..that is clearly water .....batteries would of blew up or had ashes all over the phone ... N this only pics i seen 3 of them ....nobody esle had this promble mmmmmm how weird p
Excelentes p
love this phone p
Excellent p
The phone does not work, the location of the sim card is defective, it can not read the sim card n
Good Product p
I got mine one year ago and it still work properly. I've made a good choice when I bought that phone. p
everything I expected from an Android smartphone!! p
It is NOT COMPLETELY unlocked. I can't receive MMS, because it is only unlocked part way n
Sending back !! I bought a SIM card and when I tried to put it in it wouldn't stay !! n
I bought this for my wife and while it does what she wanted it for, it does have short comings. For example, it's a hassle to get the data and internet working. I'm not sure where the option is, because there's just so much stuff, but we gave up on using it unless there's wifi. The apps work rather well, but if you're using high usage apps like Pokemon Go, this isn't the phone for you. The battery will drain within 3 hours and lags badly. Even with using basic background apps, make sure to plug this phone in or it'll die in 1-2 days.The physical quality of it is about average. A client knocked it onto the floor and stepped on it (not stopped) and the screen cracked. The phone still works, but there's fractures all over it. n
Excellent p
This would be a great phone if not for one thing: the battery. It does not hold a charge, takes more than half a day to charge, and the OS--Android--does not notify you when it is running low. When I first bought the phone, I used to get a notification, but now the phone just automatically and unexpectedly shuts off. You must also use the charger that came with it, or you will be notified of this and the battery will trickle-charge. This is perfectly reasonable, however, I did use the charger that came with it and I still got the same message.In addition to this, for some strange reason, using the camera on the phone causes it to shut off. This never used to happen when I first bought the the phone. Now, I can only turn it back on after I have the charger plugged in first. The battery was never empty when this happened either. It would shut off even after a 100% charge.The last straw from me was when I managed to turn the phone back on after a random shut off. As soon as it was on, I got caught in an infinity loop of three different error messages, one from Google's sort-of-hidden app and two HTC. I can not remember what they said, but is was something to the sort of the Google app noticing a problem and wanting to connect online to fix it, one of HTC's wanting to do the same, and the other one reporting on something else. It did not matter if I hit "OK" or "cancel," they just kept popping up one right after the other or simultaneously. I seriously have not seen this kind of non-sense with an OS since Window's '98.Somehow, between clicks I managed to navigate to "factory reset," and everything went back to normal. Yet, the battery issues did not change. I went online to see if other people were having problems like this, and there were many--though not for the error messages. And not just for this model either. It seems many of HTC's models have a problem with their battery and that the only way to have it fixed is to send the phone back to the manufacturer. The battery is not removable, or, I should say, not without voiding a warranty, and, according to other reviews, you also have to pay for shipping yourself.Now, I am not the type of person who mistreats their electronics. I have used other phones in the past, and they have held up for many years. However, the truth of the matter is is that this is the second time I have purchased this phone within six months. The reason I replaced this phone the first time was because the power button stopped working, and you need that one button to activate the screen. I did not bother getting it repaired because I had brought it refurbished and thought it better to just buy a new one.Overall, I would not recommend this or other HTC phones. The first time I used the Android OS was on a HTC DROID and it worked beautifully. However, it seems, according to other peoples' reviews, that issues came up with the battery after that model. In short, just avoid this brand. n
good p
The phone says dual sim but it is a single sim.This is not a good thing.It is a refurbished phone.The battery is so so faulty.You charged it in the morning, it will be full only for it to go off in the afternoon.It doesn't last upto 3hours, it goes off . I need to return itPls how can I return it. n
What can I say you just cant go wrong with this price p
item as described and shipped on time p
a bit late but finally arrive, is a nice phone thanks n
Product is as described and fast shipment. p
I received this smartphone in a strange box (dreadful conditions really), It does not look like an original package, neither IMEI ID on the box. The user's manual doesn't match with model's phone (just the cover page). n
My daughter loves it; however, I like it because the phone has a sticker on the back that states a Nano SIM card is included but it is not. When the seller was contacted I was told that they do not provide Nano SIM cards so I had to purchase one. p
It is very good, responsible seller p
Nice phone. Sim card slot is even smaller than anticipated. p
Love this phone,for the price you can't beat it.my only concern is that the battery is not removable. p
one of the best phones I've owned. Great sound, photos a good quality, options are endless p
Perfect p
I love it p
I would have given a five star if it was exactly how it is advertised. The fact is, it is an AT&T phone which is factory unlocked. What that means is you can't really get all its features if you don't use AT&T - I used it with T Mobile and even though voice and data worked okay, it was never possible to tether it as a mobile hotspot and use the data. This makes the phone pretty useless for me. I'm kind of forced to use AT&T - which I don't like and possibly wouldn't have bought if that was mentioned clearly. n
The phone is good p
Good phone. No complaints so far. Could easily be a five p
Bad n
This phone didn't work. Wouldn't read SIM card. The reader wasn't working. Big disappointment. n
Bought it. followed every direction. Verified it would wok with my phone service. Set it all up, got a nano-sim card from my service provider. Called customer service to have put on line. After 2 days of trying, I find out the phone is not unlocked. Amazon is the distributor. Have not figured out next plan of action. If I have to eat it I will spend eternity taking action. I spent months searching, researching, learning about phones. It's what they don't tell you that messes up your day. We don't really have a choice of being in the computer / web / phone world. No body really know WTF works with what. they say it does, but, they have not tested it. All theoretic BS. Its not the phone, its those lying about its functionality. I have never been vindictive in my life. I will not let this go. Have had enough. I have all the documentation. Wonder what courts can do for misrepresentation. n
Good phone ,I will say this phone is a best valued phone i have ever come across p
look like new with box and charger p
Good p
I've had this phone almost 2 weeks now, and I'm very happy with it so far.

It works on t-mobile and it's better than I thought. p
I was taking back that the phone doesn't use a regular Sim but a nano Sim which had to be inserted in the side of the phone that was a deal breaker for me cause I had gotten the phone for a family member overseas n
Works fine for my son. We wanted to have phones separate from contracts, and this phone works well with LTE service on AT&T (and will hopefully also work on other carriers in certain other countries.) p
my son loves this phone hooked right upwith straight talk great price too p
I had use the phone for a week. Strong signal, easy to use and navigate, right size, looks great, battery is holding 2 full days. So far I found just one issue: the calculator is really poor, it needs a serious update. The basic camera is average; however, if you play with the setting you will see a serious improvement. The construction is plastic, so I recommend a case.

I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law whose old phone was about five years out of date. She finds it very easy to use and was able to get it set up with her original Cricket phone number in minutes at the store. p
I like this phone a lot, I have purchased two HTC phones and they are full of features. It functioned perfectly on the Mexican telephone network. p
Awesome phone. p
Nice product p
scam !!! this s*** isnt unlocked do not buy ! this is my third purchase and the first two came as locked which I CLEARLY KNEW however when the discription on the phone says """"HTC Desire 610 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE.......and it came as a locked phone i belive this is some down right $^*( ------ disappointednot recomended n
I received this phone on Thursday, since then it freezes and restarts. It's very frustrating. n
This is a more affordable smart-phone for those that do not need their phone to be their personal computer. The phone works great, and the battery life is very good. The screen size and specs are adequate for basic browsing. If you just need a phone to be a phone, this is a great option. We use this with trac-fone prepaid plans, as we do not have need for large amounts of data transfer or minutes per month, which makes it a very affordable option for smartphone use. p
Working perfectly. Thanks p
Nice phone p
The battery is draining very fast. p
Item as described - should be a wonderful Christmas for my step-daughter p
Excellent phone. Great sound, and with a great display screen. Which is much larger then I expected, but is also a great thing.. U might want to think about buying a case for it because of the slimness of the phone. p
What you see is what you get. p
i wish i had done more research because the phone does not switch to sprint otherwise the phone was perfect! p
works really good, just would like it has more capacity p
Excellent phone!! It took a while to get it but let me tell you that it was a great purchase. Easy to operate, speakers in the right place with full functionality. I recommend this phone to anyone looking to upgrade! p
Supposed to be "unlocked" it is semi unlocked. You can use yo call and text but you cannot use data on it... Took it to Tmobile and they cant fix it n
My first smart phone. So needed a easy transition. This one is just that. Easy to use and gets you into all the apps and smart phone gadgets. Installing apps was a breeze. Not too big in the pocket. So for the price its a great phone. p
Excellent product p
I don't know how the phone works because so far we can't even turn it on. The instructions that came with the phone are not accurate at all. For example, the instructions say to remove the back with your finger.Ha! That is a joke! It is nt humanly possible to take the back of the phone off without a sharp tool. Next the instructions tell us to remove the battery and install the SD card underneath. A) the battery isn't removable and B) there is no place underneath to install an SD card. So after almost ruining the phone due to bad instructions we find a place to install SIM amd SD on the side. Ugh! n
This was my second HTC Desire 610 phone I drop my first one about 30ft high but I have to say this is a nice phone for the price! p
Great Phone. Love it. p
I bought this phone last week and in India now. I jot able to use it with any and m card . its asking for unlock code. Pla help me n
It was broken when I got it n
The phone is locked! the title is misleading.its written unlock phone but the phone is actually locked to AT&T networkbig disappointment! n
Got it for my daughter and she loves the phone. The only thing is, she said the battery looks used! p
excellent product, the purchase is made as agreed, recommended selle p
great phone beautiful pictures p
Works mint. Thank You. p
The hotspot is blocked. You can not share internet from my mobile phone n
Nice phone I love it. p
The phone is good overall but the hotspot function doesn't work at all!!! n
It was a great price for a good phone, considering all phones are (even older models) are a minimum of $200. I'm thoroughly enjoying this phone. p
This phone was very bad.had 2 give 1 star tho. That's y I returned it. Volume was low. Screen quality was poor. The phone in general felt cheap. Would not recommend. n
it's a very good smartphone, but camera is it weak point. p
Fast and simple (not a lot of customization functions available). Camera sucks not as good as the OnePlus or Samsung S6 or IPhone. Small memory. n
Would not work in our area with AT&T. Had to sell it. p
I've wasted lots of time with T-Mobile trying to get this thing to make a 4G connection, and haven't been able to get anything but 2G. Now it's past the short return window and I'm stuck with it. n
No as good as I expected... it is OK ... but definitely not a go n
It didn't come with a SIM card and the one I already have doesn't fit. But I like the phone. p
Wonderfuk,surpassed my expectations p
The phone is good and it allows me to watch movies it takes out clear pictures p
I am very happy with this phone. I have had this phone for a few months now and I have had no issues. I downgraded from an HTC M8 to the HTC desire when my old phone broke. There is no difference in performance that I have noticed.The Good:Very affordable. Easy to navigate through everything. The screen looks amazing. I watch movies on it all the time. it is bright enough to see during daytime. The speakers are loud and clear. The battery usually lasts me all day. I love the swipe to text feature! it makes texting so much easier! It is a very light phone. I enjoy the option to have power saver and extreme power saver. They often come in handy.The Bad:Sometimes when I lose a data connection I have to restart my phone to regain the connection. It comes with 4.20 GB available. Which is enough for most things. I added an external SD card to increase the storage.Overall this is a great phone. I would buy this phone again. it works just as good as a $300 phone. p
If there is a chance to put "zero" star, definitely I put zero star for this item. This piece look like black and white piece. Display is worst. If I increase the brightness still it's same, unable to read messages because of the worst brightness. The camara doesn't work. It has low quality camara. Usually HTC mobile's has good name on camera quality but this one is worst. I ever seen like this piece. My friends who used this same piece they got good one but I got bad one. Frankly I don't blame HTC brand but I do blame Amazon. They only sent us that piece. n
I am disappointed n
This phone is no good I bought it on april and it's stop working in June, the SIM card reader is broken I don't know what I can do with this phone n
I bought this phone for mom because I was coming on vocation and now I'm here on vocation it's not working, not receiving incoming nor outgoing calls. What do I do? n
The battery huffed and equipment does not work and can not return because it's been 30 days n
Everything arrived as expected, the phone is very good, has not presented any problems, the sound is great, the front camera is not the best, but it works great, I love, thank you very good product I love this HTC p
Like p
I'm from Venezuela, I bought the phone, and, as a Movistar user, I have to say it works just fine. I can do my phone calls and navegate with no problem. If you are looking for a high-tech phone, that is within the range of a hundred, this is a great option for you. Also, the phone is fast and simple to the use. It won't let you down. p
Started using and performance is very good. p
Wow..I bought my cousin that phone who is living out of this country he tells me that he really loves that phone,it makes nice selfi ...the comminication comes really clear no problm at all so far.... p
Screen resolution is not good at all. You will feel, you are using some 5-6 year old phone. Rest is good n
Smooth and fast but the screen quality was poor as well as the sound related to the price tag n
Works really well, takes great pictures. p
It's a really great gadget. I love it. Just one little that I don't like though. There is no designated icon to access the memory card files without going to video or music. I also can't email documents because of the same problem. p
as they announced its unlocked and works for GSM carrier like AT&T and T-mobile so I bought it ,never could use the data can't open email or browse the net called T- mobile to fix the data issue for 3 weeks changing settings nothing finally I realized that broadband on that phone doesn't work on T-mobile and I have to buy another phone if I want to use the data so beware n
good product. received in due time n
A complete disaster. Everything is wrong about this phone. After few weeks the phone started to hang all the time. The camera doesn't work. It comes with all the at@t apps and takes a lot of space making the phone very slow. the apps doesn't work when you move those to sd card. The packaging was very poor. It was opened before. They said they wanted to make sure it works. Now I feel like it's a used phone. I wouldn't recommend this. n
VERY WELL p
is for someone else but he said that is good p
Great for the price p
OK n
excellent p
I have had this phone for a few months now and it is one of the best phones i have ever owned. It is fast and easy to use and has amazing camera clarity. Overall, amazing phone. p
muy buen producto. p
It's nice phone and very fast I love it... p
Everything seems to be working perfectly! p
i received my phone yesterday its a great phone but the camera on it is not working and that pisses me off n
The smartphone did not meet my expectations. The camera does not take pictures focused. All photos are out of focus. I lost my money, I'm disappointment. I want my money back. I bought when visiting in new york, I am now in my country. Is a disaster! n
very responsible seller highly recommend it. p
I'm not sure if the seller, sold me a faulty phone or not. However, I purchased this phone as a gift. The person has been having trouble with the phone since day 1. Calls go straight to voicemail, I have to call 4 or 5 times for the call to go through. Just awful and a waste of my money. n
Works as advertised and fulfills its purpose.Also comes with a six month special warranty where they claim they will fix a broken screen. Haven't had to try it out fortunately but strikes me as a nice add to the product. p
For all of those having issues with data connection, this is an issue that shouldn't arise, but I have your solution!!! I just fixed mine today. I have Vodafone DE for reference. All you have to do is download the app called "APN Settings" from the play store and find your carrier. Record the APN info it provides you with, then go to your mobile data settings, select APNs, click the three dots at the top and select New APN, and fill in the blanks and save it. Then click the dot to the far right to select the APN you created, and viola! Welcome to your unlocked, functional HTC Desire 610!*Note: This method has worked for me and many others. I hope it works for you too, but I'm not claiming it will. Also, you must alter your APN every time you switch carriers. p
ok p
loved it only problem with display p
It's good as described p
EXCELENT!! p
Very good phone, p
Lovely phone. My Dad loves it p
The only good phone HTC made was the ONE. and the T-Mobile g1 lol.This phone so slow, lag, KitKat, front facing speakers not even as loud as my lg Leon I got for $40, not even loud as iPhone speakers so quiet tons of bloatware, very little storage space, user interface clunky crowded slow useless and boring. Even installing launcher makes phone the still BAD BAD BAD! n
Not unlocked. Bought it for my son, so it was a while before he completed enough for me to look into the issue. T-Mobile can not send text messages with pictures. They say "downloading" but never do. No Internet either. I called tmobile AND HTC. After those conversations, they said the phone was unlocked incorrectly causing them to not be able to correct the issue. Sansung has awesome low end devices now, so I just went to the tmobile store instead. A deal is rarely a deal, now a days. n
Very good phone for the price.Great camera and more than needed fro general use.Very happy. p
Poor camera and screen display n
Excellent product, good phone, very reliable seller p
THIS IS THE BEST ANDROID 4.4 kitkat 4G LTE 8 GB PHONE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET FOR $123.00 ONLY FOR NEW UNLOCKED PHONE.8 GB IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANY REGULAR PHONE USER WHO USES VERY FEW APPS.AND FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.IF YOU CAN ADD A MEMORY CARD ALSO.IT IS A PLUS POINT. p
Pros.Easy to use, long battery life.ConsI am not able to disable the password pin, and cannot see the screen when I am out in the sun p
very nice .. exelente cell p
I love this phone! Does exactly what I need and the layout is attractive and clear. The camera is not fantastic, but it does just fine for smartphone. The only real drawback are the many bloatware AT&T apps that come preloaded and cannot be deleted. They take up half of the 8 gb right off the bat and they cannot even be moved to the SD card. It is working great on the Pure Talk network. Tracfone does not accept it, as it is an AT&T GoPhone whach has never been activated on AT&T. But the Pure Talk SIM worked immediately and call quality is very good. p
I absolutely love this phone, lightweight, runs fast, works well in Trinidad on Digicel's network. Has all the features I need and expandable memory. Great Value for money p
Front camera does not work first issue I've ever had w amazon it's not their fault u guys have always been great. Unfortunately my business is ran through my phone I'm going to order a note 3 in a few days if there's anyway I can get a discount I'd appreciate it and I'll always b loyal n
This phone is excellent, (THIS DOES NOT HAVE NFC) aside from that i am very happy and would recommend it 100% Great and different design, screen is really good against some reviews on the internet that say bad screen p
Incredible phone without any problem. This phone is really fast and worth the money. p
Great phone by all standards. p
It's full unloked. p
I got this mobile yesterday in AT&T Go Phone box. Its working fine when I use AT&T sim card, but when I tried to use LycaMobile sim card on the main screen its saying the message as "Network Locked, contact customer care" and asking to enter SIM Network Unlock PIN. Could someone please help what the process to use this for other networks apart from AT&T? n
Excellent condition, item was exactly as advertised! p
Great p
I bought it for my mom, and it fits for her. She loves it. p
Awesome phone!! p
Great phone have no complaints and I like android over apple products. p
screen broke within a month of purchasing n
It has a battery problem!Bought this mobile in October 2015 and brought it to India. Started using in November and now in December I am regretting my decision to buy this phone.The touch is brilliant and haven't seen any other issue until now.But Battery is a major pain point. Whenever I use the mobile constantly for 15-20 minutes the battery just drains to 0%, irrespective of whether its 30% or 90%.Can't perform any activity for more than 15 mins until its plugged in else it will just shut down.Even a cheapest ever mobile would have a better battery.Since I bought it to India I can't claim the warranty and I am looking for a place to launch a formal complaint. n
Great phone i already have it for a few months and i have no complains at all, fast great sice, the screen is not bad at all as some people say that "the screen sucks" not at all. p
I liked the phone a lot BUT it stopped working on Tmobile's network a couple weeks into using it. I had to call tmobile to get it to work in the first place and called back to troubleshoot the second problem again and they couldn't fix it. So I'm returning it. I couldn't send picture messages while it was "working" either but I never called anyone abt that. I had blu phones before but they break very easy. I never had a problem with them working on the network though. n
Will not work with T-Mobile. Internet will not work with T-Mobile. Phone not even unlocked. Don't buy! n
I was terribly disappointed with the packaging of the device. It also says the device is new but the one I got looks used. The box was opened and not shut properly. And the packaging was terrible and held together by a thin piece of clear tape . n
Not satisfied at all. The delivery is not on time. n
Excelente p
Had a RAZR MAXX and like the 610 much more. A little taller but skinner width. Easy to use. Just popped in my ATT sim card, turned it on and started loading it up with the apps I like. My only complaint would be the wasted instruction booklet. Each page is just slightly larger than a business card and the font size is probably a 1 or 2 and hardly any ink at all. Color light gray. Why the chinese think saving paper is such a rewarding thing to do. Don't get me wrong, I want to save trees, too, but give us a break. How about minimum font size being 8 with black ink used on ALL instruction manuals. Please.Hats off and two thumbs up on the Desire 610 phone however! Thanks. p
I bought this cell phone for my husband and he loves it. p
The description of this phone is very misleading and this is why it previously got one star from me.If however you're on AT&T then awesome! Works like a charm so far with very fast loading internet.Screen brightness is a bit blah - but not a crisis for me; Expected better picture quality but alas and you gotta charge it every day even for me who is not a heavy user.Overall great value for money p
Excellent p
You say it will work with metro pcs, but I can't get the SIM card in. n
Fast, feature rich, good looking, AWESOME PHONE!!! p
I bought this a year ago and it still does it's job! Really good battery life, loud front facing speakers, and I haven't broke it yet despite me dropping it a few times. Personally, the only thing I dislike is the camera quality.I'm going to buy a new phone soon, because my apps simply are too slow for this model and it's software now but I do reccomend this! p
very nice phone for this price ...Although the phone is little heavy and not that sleek wht it looks in the image . But the features are good for the value p
good p
It works perfectly in Venezuela, with Movistar. Its Fast, a lot of memory, good size, good aps.. I love it. p
Great phone but does not work overseas with Internet p
Cheap made, basic phone for tue price. n
Totally p
Everything perfect.... didn't miss anything. n
Bought it for my nephew who's on T-Mobile, a definite upgrade from what he had (looked like a pager with a screen). At the phone store, they confirmed it was unlocked, so I popped a new SIM in there and he was good to go.He said he had to go back later to have them check it out, the SIM or something was acting weird. Got it fixed, and it's worked fine since. Definitely recommend. p
I ordered an HTC and received and LG phone. After installing my apps and customizing the phone I realize that the phone is a LG. Very upset. Too late to send back as I am traveling. n
Very god p
This is a great phone, for the money. We replaced two 5year old Samsungs that were having trouble with being able to run newer apps. This is not the newest OS out there but it's a few steps up. It's an AT&T phone so it's loaded up with their stuff, it would be nice if it wasn't, but again, there's a price trade off. This phone was released only two years ago so I figure I'm good for at least five years. I had an HTC for my first smart phone and I'm looking forward to using this one. So far, (2 weeks), there is no disappointment. p
NOT HAPPY AT ALL HAVE LOT PORBLEM WITH PHONE CAN SENT PIC OR REVICED THEM n
Great phone. Though, its hard to get accessories for it (I know its not one of the newer phones out). No one here seems to carry HTC stuff (at a decent price anyway). p
One of the good phone that fit the budget but was very disappointed on its display quality. The display quality is a bit dark compared to its competitors within its range. Other than that the phone is slim and stylish. n
Great! p
I really love it thanks for this product i love it p
The phones battery is horrible. I placed an order for a new one but got a used on that looked pretty new and I was okay with that. But now 3 months later Im buying another phone because the battery won't last a day if you use it. :( n
Not unlocked n
Good phone but it cracking up at the back and peeling off p
Love the phone. No issue at all. p
okay n
Not much to say. Phone arrived new in box in good quality, powered right on, and has had no problems since purchasing it 3 months ago. p
Very bad product. The phone that was sent to me had a replacement display which was neither bright nor visible outdoor. Sent it as a gift our of the country or else would have returned. n
Love it p
The phone itself was lovely, I absolutely wish I could have kept it, however the sim card used for this phone is smaller than the micro sim most phones use and was not compatible with my carrier. I've been wanting an HTC for a while now and it sucks that I had to return it. p
Awesome p
First HTC 610 worked perfectly, but this one is out to the factory for repair. Will update when unit is returned. n
Best Phone Ever Love it.. p
It looks great, had to order a sim card so have not had the chance to set it up yet. My son loves his so I have no doubts I will too. p
Love it p
excellent p
Excelent p
Great phone p
Bad to buy this product from amazon. It shows as unlocked but no USA career work on it. Looks like i need to spend $ to get it unlocked again. n
Good phone for price p
Worst phone I've seen. Having problems with touch screen and sometimes won't work at all. n
buenisimo p
I bought this cell like a gift for my mom she live in other country and the battery exploded one moths after, I don't know if the phone have a warranty but I cant get this phone, I'm very disappointed, btw I bought 2 and the other one is working very good n
This was bought for my grandson, he has not received it as yet, but I know he will love it because he loves his mom p
Works well in Ghana p
DOA - didn't recognize SIM card. n
Nice phone. Not disappointed at all. Had an emergency, will recommend the HTC. Big bang for the buck. Thanks Amazon and HTC. p
Even though it is mentioned as unlocked phone, i received AT&T locked phone. Please do not buy this in case you are looking for unlocked phone.It will be better if product description can be updated saying it is locked phone to avoid customer confusion. n
Very good products p
its very nice p
excelent movil p
excelente p
Good phone..good service p
Good phone p
I think overall it's an excellent phone.Loses charge rather quickly. But overall great Android p
4 stars not 5. p
I like the phone but it is a gift p
Great Phone & service. Thanks p
nice phone p
I'm not happy with the smartphone that I bought here, HTC desire 610. The charger is used and the principal Camara is not working right like cloudy. I know that the Camara is 8 mpx,so is not so good, but the frontal Camara(1.3) is working better than the principal. n
Overall it is a good phone but the camera quality is very poor n
The phone is fast and good. I am using as a spare for visitors. The only knock is that these phone is preloaded with bunch of bloatware from AT&T and it is impossible to get rid of unless you root the phone. The AT&T logo is also on the splash screen.... p
Nice phone!! p
One month ago, I purchased one and gave one star rating because it did not work and the service was not good. This time the phone I got worked fine so far and I give 5 stars. p
Work excellent in PanamÃ¡, the unique bad thing is the Hostpot locked p
HTC cheats people by giving them a partially unloacked AT and T mobile. The mobile hotspot function does not work if you have a sim card of ssome other network. What is the point of unlocking it then. Even rooting does not work since no custom ROMs are available fro Desire. Please do not buy.. Customer care guys also said they cant help. Utterly disappointed. n
the phone sold as new, and yet I came back with striped camera, besides the sensor screen is bad and hardly grabs when you will use it, without there sides of the screen that does not grab the touch buy the phone from Venezuela and I can not afford to use for forwarding the change of it n
the other person can only listen if you use a headphone or put it in specker! that means the microphone is brocken..!!!! n
Phone is not reading the sim card. Message coming up is"No Sim Card".I took it to a cell phone repair place where i was told the sim reader is faulty. They ordered a replacement one online and now i have to wait two weeks for it to get here. Very dissapointing. n
good n
good working condition everything was as promices p
simcard reader is broken n
the product arrived very quickly. However, the smartphone has several problems with battery and charger. It was a very good deal to be true... n
It met all of my expectations! I am happy to have purchased the phone at a great cost. Always looking forward to purchasing from you guys... Thank you and blessings to all... p
Fast shipping. The item is excellent. p
Stopped working after 9 months ! n
The phone arrived little late. But it is as desired. The box do not have ear phone. p
This cell phone os great love it. The package is a brand new p
Very good p
Its NOT unlocked phone, does not work with carriers other than ATnT. I have gifted the phone to my sister and she is disappointed with it, does not work with other networks. n
Nice phone. Works perfectly in the caribbean p
The phone is blocked on At&t and i've not been able to use my t mobile card. it looks used. It's very annoying. Bought a second one from another seller with the same issue. Don't buy this product! n
It was good experience p
No working now the start button dont work n
So, I bought this phone as a back up to my iPhone 6. I was walking around by the pool, I slipped and fell into said pool. My iPhone was in my pocket so it was out for a few days and I was without phone when I needed it. So I decided to get a back up. I did my research, not a huge fan of android phones but i wanted to give a try. I didn't want to slash a lot of money on a back up phone so this phone made the point. First impression : it's good phone, I hope it will live up to my expectations. By the way I'm using this phone in Veneuzela and it's working perfectly. The camera is decent on this phone, but i seldom take pictures so this is no problem. I downloaded some essential apps from the play store and configured it to my personal preference. Two months, this phone is always around, I purchased a Samsung 128 Gb expansion sd card for it. Now I use as a back up and a music player. It's around 1/8 of the iPhone's price so it's my going running phone too. (Robbers tend to look for iPhones or Samsungs so this phones is not attracting any looters). All in all a decent phone, and for the price, it lives up to the expectation. p
Fabuloussss!!!!! p
Not unlocked n
I am totally satisfied. No problems or issues. p
Excellent phone....I live all the way in the Caribbean so I was really afraid to purchase an electronic online. My fears were "what if it doesn't work?" But it does....I'm so happy. I love the phone features...it's so clear and bright and takes great pics p
Awesome, is fast and screen is big! p
Camera picture quality is not so good. n
Nice deal, nice phone, I am happy!! would do business with this seller again!! thanks p
phone keep shuting down....had to return it.it seems like i am not the only one returning it. n
I have not really used it but it appears to be of good quality. p
Very good, thanks a lot.Regards p
This is an incredibly slow phone. It is only good to make phone calls and text, if that is what you want then you don't need to spend on this phone, any other phone can do this. Forget about using a browser or trying to access anything online. If you try to load a site like bloomberg, yahoo or any site with more than one picture it will take forever or more often the case won't work. Fancy case, fancy graphics, fancy tools but at the end of the day a horrible phone. n
Battery issues. battery runs out fast. The camera also not very good quality. n
It s very good and balanced phone. I don t like only how long takes the battery to recharge and its durability. p
Great phone! I love it p
An excellent purchase that met and surpassed my expectations. n
Phone needs to be returned keeps shutting off and restarting n
great, so comfortable to use. p
Really bad camera!!! Product returned! n
No english manual n
The phone available storage is not 4G it only has 2G of memory which meant that transitioning from my previous HTC desire which has 8G internal memory was tedious, only a few of my apps where trasnfered automatically because of the limited space. the settings are also limited vs older HTC models. Call settings are not in the queue. It is much bigger than I expected but I adjusted to the size. The phone is slow because the internal storage is used up. I needed a dual SIM phone to avoid walking around with two phones but I wouldn't buy this again because the low memory n
This Phone is one of the best laying, in my family there are iPhones, Samsung, Nokia and HTC. It is unfortunate that of the HTC brand is so unrecognized For indeed make excellent Phones, about This phone must say the following: Despite having a low density of pixels the image quality is very good, the sound is probably one of Better than heard, the software is just fantastic, BlinkFeed is a super practical display, everything you want to know is there, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, news, sports, finance is like having a dynamic magazine. everything is within reach and easy. 2 things: for those with heating problems this has been solved by upgrading to lollipop 5, for those with onky Chinese options in BlinkFeed nothing is more complicated, your have an equipment for China , look for a technical service to change the Cid of your phone to another region, can be HTC__622 who despite being Asian allows to feeds and news from America, to do that you must put your phone in S-Off, which is complex, look on the Internet for help. p

Battery issues. battery runs out fast. The camera also not very good quality. n
One of the best phones I've ever had, is my first HTC and I'm very happy with it, excellent in quality and price. Good HD screen 5 inches, with a very vivid colors. Very nice in design, excellent materials used, good performance with games and applications ... but not everything is perfect, since it only has 8GB of internal memory and only the system occupies 4GB, and when downloading and update the applications more Used by all we have 2.2gb, of course can be solved with sd memory but only for certain applications. I would have loved to have 16 GB of memory and a battery of 3000mah, but for the price that has this equipment I think very reasonable all the features it has.I do not regret having this phone and from now on I stay with the HTC devices. p
Excellent! p
Excellent phone by the price p
The package arrived on time, but the original packaging was tampered with. Taking it to AT&T tomorrow to get it set up. Hope all goes well. I am not happy with this. n
Excellent product, 100% recommended p
Everything is good p
love the phone,great pictures... p
It ok but didn't realize it was a built in battery. The tablet case is not adjustable to stand. p
This is an AT&T phone. Comes in AT&T box and the box is not sealed. Looks like it's an open box item and wasn't mentioned any where. Also AT&T branded software as well. Not happy with the purchase. Don't buy! n
This phone is nice one...good feature...it came with at&t logo ..its unlocked...but one thing about it that it is new phone but company don't provide earphone in the box.... n
Once I got my phone hooked up correctly through my provider I was really happy with it. Great phone for the price!!! p
Bands 4g and 3g are wrong in te description. This is an at&t pone. No wired stereo head set in te box. No recomended n
Bought the phone for my daughter who just loves it. Lucky I had a micro SS card for her video and audio files. p
I had a desire 610 for almost three years and it is still working but I needed more room so I ordered the desire 626 and I love it. I really like that the keys are white and I have bad eyesight and it makes it so much easier. I haven't found a thing that I don't like about it yet!!! Also I will never buy another brand of phone!!!! p
I bought this phone and it got scratches all over . It came without no charger nor the phone case and box. n
Excellent phone p
Lies this didn't come unlocked now I'll have to pay to do it. n
I definitely recommend it! p
Phone sucked; no SIM card slot, had to spend another 30 for the SIM card slot which was a total inconvenience n
I've had my Desire 626 for about 2 weeks now and I'm as in love with it as when I first opened it. Bought mine unlocked from Azteka Wireless, very reasonably priced. Functions very well, I don't know why this phone has bad reviews. After owning an iPhone 4S and a Microsoft Lumia 640, this is a very nice step up.If you're one of those people who doesn't really mind all the technical mumbo jumbo about camera quality, processing power, and all that, it's a real capable phone. I haven't had a single issue with mine. p
The data does not work on this phone. I'm highly dissatisfied. I would not have purchased this phone or accessories if I had known this. It was a waste of money and I'm still without a working phone. I will not suggest to friends or purchase a phone on amazon ever again. n
my daughter is happy p
Everything we expected and more! Had a minor hiccup with setting up AT&T service, but after our second visit we were all set. p
So far so good...seems to be a good deal! p
This is nice phone sexual p
I definitely recommend it! p

Cute phone. But definitely not what I expected. It's missing a lot of features I expected a smartphone to have. Needless to say I'll be selling it in a few weeks. n
No when I got my phone the package was open and it took me almost a week and a half to get my phone up and running correctly n
Great item , got it fast . my son happy .. Thanks p
Straight trash i bought this phone and took great care of it and it only lasted 3 weeks. I was listening to music and it the screen turned all white then turned off. I could never get it to turn on again. Complete waste of money. n
Good phone and fast shipment thank you. p
Good slim phone, very stylish. The only problems I can address is the small storage capacity and the speakers when trying to play YouTube or music only utilizes the bottom speaker near where you talk. n
Biggest waste of money my phone was broken when I recieved it n
this phone, when it comes as used.. has a lot of hits around. heavy damaged. so be careful about getting one... n
I love the phone...doesn't lag or slow down...call quality is HD which I love!!! p
I love this phone. Colors are great. Runs smoothly and fast. p
The product was received quickly and looks great. Problem...it works with nano SIMs!!Nowhere in the description is this mentioned. So I cannot cut my regular sized sims because apparently they would be too thick.I am so disappointed. n
is an ok phone, but my complain is that the product is not exactly what you can find in the video reviews. The headphones arent the one that the video reviews says and also the model of them dont match. Didnt come with any case and i expect that. It perform WELL kind of annoying the HTC apps but easy to deactivate. Very intuitive tough. n

This a a midrange phone packed with premium features, a 5.5â€œ display with vibrant colors, boom sound speakers and a decent performance.You can't go wrong with this phone. p
Great price for the phone, however, the charger stopped working so I don't know what to do with the phone now... n
excellent p
Had to return the device because of the limitations it runs on kit Kat. the OS took up all the internal memory then you couldnt move apps to the memory card because of kit Kat. Still wanted a dual SIM phone and I found the HTC desire 826 it is a beast of a phone. Runs on Lollipop with great feature and a great camera get that phone instead n
Great phone great price delivered on time with excellent service even at the door I'm very happy with this p
The article came the estimated time, but when put into use would not grab more cargo, the article is reflected by the seller as new, but the article when put in use and not discharge charge in the battery is faulty . n
This is clearly one of the best phone l have l can think of in terms of my needs. A salid machine that does everything telephoning. I have brought several but this is different, solid and reliable simple. p
The system of HTC Desire it's an old one and I cannot update it and the camera is not that clear!!! n
Very good p
Excellent Device! p
amazing p
Muy Bueno p
I ordered black color and received white but still its OK n
No because in every video I saw the HTC desire 816 had sense 6.0 and my phone has 5.5. The charger doesn't charge. n
This phone arrived on-time and in great condition. Even though there was a little difficulty getting the phone activated, NGP_US_STORE provided excellent customer service and accurate recommendations. Many thanks from a happy customer. p
Good p
works very well, I recommend, this HTC DESIRE 816?:GSM Quad-Band 850/900/1800/1900 Mhz2G Network GSM 850/900/1800/19003G Network UMTS 900/1900/2100 p
SIM 1 (Slot 1) ATTI took the phone to ATT store to activate; the idiot in the store was more interested in playing with the phone then actually getting it to work. I left the store very unsatisfied. But the phone was working and I can make and receive phone calls and text messages.The phone does work on ATT on the first slot (SIM 1). With the DATA.I spent 2 hours on the phone with ATT to get this phone to work on their service.. Finally it did. Be persistent; and patient with ATT.This phone will work well on DATA plans in the US.. Unfortunately, U.S carriers would prefer that you use a handset locked to their services. At home, they'd rather you not swap in different provider's SIM. And while this last part is changing to some degree, carriers would prefer that you use one of their roaming partners when you take your phone overseas (they get some money that way).SIM 2 (Slot 2) T-MobileI decided to get another line activated since T-Mobile on the second slot.Make sure you understand, On T-mobile it works on EdgeEDGE is considered a pre-3G Technology. Which means it is VERY SLOW.. Like Dial Up.. the only thing this phone is good for is wifi..forget about trying to upload a picture to Facebook on this unless you are on wifi..Using the second slot (SIM 2) is best for 3rd world countries. Not the United statesOverall i love this phone. p
This is a great phone . Meets all my expectations! I don't have anything bad to say about the phone. The only thing is, it will only fit a mini sim card. I had to cut mine and file it down to fit into the phone. p
Very bad experience. n
Good luck getting rid of all the Chinese writing and labels. Why would a vendor provide an item in Chinese into an English speaking country? n
Update May 2015:I am very disappointed to report that my HTC 816 broke after just using it for 4 months. Unfortunately, because I bought it online, there is no warranty, so I am out the $300+ that I spent on it and the case. It happened when I went overseas. I had gotten a SIM card from the country I was in to use my phone there. Around the same time, my phone started over-heating and the download arrow at the top of the phone looked as if it were continuously downloading something, and would run for hours. I'd turn off the phone because it was over heating, but when I'd turn the phone on again, I'd continue to have the same problem. Then the screen became less and less sensitive to touch until it became completely non-responsive and I couldn't use any application or function on the phone at all. I don't know if it's a problem with the phone itself, or the SIM card from overseas that caused the problem. It would cost $100 to have the screen repaired at HTC, but I think I'll just buy a new phone. I am SO disappointed because I loved my new phone - everything worked perfectly until the overheating/screen problem, and I'd only had it for 4 months. I will not make the mistake of buying a phone without warranty again.December 2014 review:I have had my HTC phone for about 3 weeks, and I love it. My old phone was an iPhone, which I couldn't wait to get rid of. It took a couple days to become familiar with the android system, but it wasn't as difficult as I thought. The screen is large and has great resolution. The pictures taken on the 13 mp camera look great - I'm amazed how good the low-lighting pictures turned out - they were even better than ones taken with my real camera. The speakers are loud with good sound quality. The phone fully charges in about 3 hours, and has a long battery life - longer than the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. I usually go 1 1/2 to 2 days between charges. You can set the screen unlock to either swipe or PIN. It has 8 GB of internal memory, and unlike with an iPhone which doesn't allow extra memory, you can add up to 128 GB of storage.I liked that it has 2 SIM slots - unfortunately, my carrier Metro PCS doesn't provide service to dual SIM phones - they only provide the SIM for one slot, not both. I'm still going to make good use of the 2nd SIM slot when I travel overseas.There was some confusion when I first got the phone and was calling around for carriers who could support the dual SIM on my phone. Some carriers I contacted told me one SIM slot was for GSM, the other was for CDMA. As I found out in the end, both slots are for GSM SIM cards. I took the phone to Sprint, Metro PCS, T--Mobile and Verizon, and they all told me that at this time they will not connect my unlocked phone to their system, even though they have the ability to do so. They are not required to connect unlocked phones to their network, and do not want to, since they want people to buy their locked phones so they can lock people into 2 year contracts and get people to pay more over the 2 year term. Metro PCS and Consumer Cellular were the only ones I found who would connect the unlocked phone to their service.As was noted in other reviews, it appears this phone was intended to be sold in the Chinese market - the newsfeed and Tips & Help were in Chinese, even though all of the Language settings were in English U.S. I took off the newsfeed because I don't use it, but I can't seem to change Tips & Help to English. I've tried to have Chinese speakers look on the Tips & Help to see if there's a language setting that's different than the phone settings, but there isn't one.Other than that, I am very pleased with my phone, and would highly recommend it. n
This phone search is starting to make my head hurt. After reading reviews I knew I was not going to get 4G, but come on can I at least get 3G? I love everything about the phone I even ordered cases as the same time b/c I knew I was keeping it well Iâ€™m sad to say the cases and phone has to go back to Amazon. I donâ€™t even get 3G service and Iâ€™m with ATT, I was going to deal with 3G just because I like the phone that much but unless Iâ€™m on Wi-Fi I can not do anything. My Netflix donâ€™t even work and having a 5 year old with out Netflix is not working to well. Phone search continues.... p
I have to say it wasnâ€™t like this at the beginning, i was excited about this phone, when i first had it in my hands it was weird, but the delivery man told me it would work, so i went to my house very excited about it, but i started to notice something weird, i couldnâ€™t hear anything from the speakers, like they werenâ€™t even there, i didnâ€™t mind and started to use it on my house and thatâ€™s when i started to get mad, the screen never turned on, itâ€™s like they were transparent , invisible, i prayed to the gods for help and nothing happened, i prayed to joseph smith and nothing happened, even to the devil itself and the screen was still like watching a crystal, Iâ€™m so disappointed about this phone and i donâ€™t want it anymore, i tried to find the delivery man later and no one knew him, it's like he was a ghost or something can someone please help me with it, hereâ€™s a pic, maybe someone can help me with this problem. n

O.K. Here's what I've gone through for the last five or six weeks. I ordered the HTC Desire 816d and received a HTC Desire 816g from one dealer. I returned the phone and got a refund. Luckily the dealer was in the US. Then I ordered another HTC Desire 816d from another dealer. This time I received a HTC Desire 816w. This phone is being returned as I write this -TO CHINA! I'm hoping that the phone will not go on A SLOW BOAT. I must have the HTC Desire 816d for Verizon and Tracfone. The phone must be a CDMA phone and not GSM. In the meantime I ordered and received about $100.00 worth of items like cell phone cases, glass screen shields, micro sd cards and simcards for registration into the TRACFONE BRING YOUR OWN PHONE PROGRAM. I just ordered my third HTC Desire 816d from a third dealer today. As I am writing this I have my toes crossed on both of my feet and when I'm done typing this I'll cross my fingers on both hands and hope that the third times a CHARM..... Just one more bit of information, the two phones that aren't the "d" model are $80-$150 less than the "d" model. n
My phone does not recognize my sim card GSM. Can you help me? E-mail: drsalasvip @ Hotmail. n
Did not see the charging cable and does not know where it got missing. p

i bought this phone recently. works well up to now. only problem is that blinkfeed is in Japanese although I have been able to change the phone language to English via settings, languages and all that. also when I make a call some Japanese can still be seen on the screen. I've bought other unlocked HTC phones before but this is the first time I've had this problem. if anyone had some suggestions I would appreciate it. n

Item gets overheated. returned it... n
So its been almost 3 months since I've had my phone. Initially I was worried about the size. But its just right. Perfect to watch movies on and the front speakers are amazing!!! Love that design HTC. I don't walk with my laptop or tablet anymore. (Be ensure to order a case with a kickstand so you wont have to hold the phone in your hand....it hurts after awhile.) I am in Jamaica and I use both Sim slots. (Digicel, Lime) the camera quality is great. Only problem is indoors, if improper lighting the quality isn't that great, but that doesn't matter. I was also worried about the speed. Most dual Sim phones after a while slows down. But this bad boy is kicking still. And I love the ability to have external storage. Overall its a great phone for a great price. p
Performance is not as mentioned in specifications n
best mobile p
only the chanise manual and apps with some time jellybean frizing is the main problem so far. n
Was giving me stress n
Do not buy form this seller. The phone that they send is NOT the international version, but rather the Chinese version. When I tried to install the app Clean Master, it told me that a Chinese version was already installed on the device so I went into the app manager and uninstalled it. Immediately afterwards the phone rebooted itself and won't get past the startup htc screen. n
I am very satisfy with it. though that the youtube app is not working. p
Did not have any significant problems using this phone. Phone camera is pretty good. Speed is not bad as well. p
Got a different phone instead of the one offered spend time for nothing n
Got the white and blue international version .. phone works great ... got it a lot faster than expected as well ... the only problem I have with it is the ringing volume is very soft and the vibration is very very light... this phone is being used in Trinidad West indies works on both Digicel and Bmobile network p
A great product with a great price! The phone works very well ever since I got it. No battery issue so far as other reviewers have mentioned. Bought another one for my niece and will get one for my husband! p
I got my phone on time but I'm sad because of the screen it seems its lifting not pleased at all about this. n
Good phoneðŸ‘ p
This phone is not working after 3 months and since it has no warranty it'll not be supported by HTC US. No way to get this phone working in US. n
My wife loves this phone. p
It is a terrible purchase. I wait for 2 weeks for this phone to arrive. Once I opened the packaging, the box seem cheap and low quality. In addition, this phone is supposed to be LTE, however, the internet connection is 10x slower than my old SONY. n
Excellent cell phone p
I am very satisfied with this phone, good phone for this price and I would give a thumbs up to anyone who is thinking of getting a great phone for a reasonable price. p
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PHONE. The camera does not work. It gives an error message: "Camera has stopped unexpectedly. An error report will be send to HTC to help us improve our products." Called HTC customer service. They attempted to trouble-shoot but it still did not work. Since it is an international phone, it has no warranty! n
Very short battery life n
So far so good ...it is all i expected for. For me only - is the baterry, runs out very fast. p
This is high C/P phone. p
great experience p
This phone is horrible, the touch screen don't even work. I tried to reboot my phone and still not working. n
I have been using it for more than a month. So far no problem. Like the color of the phone p
This is a great device with an excellent display and camera, the display can even compete with the one on the Samsung Galaxy S 6, the boom sound Dolby Digital feature isn't the loudest however it does give a nice panoramic sound. The ONLY bad thing about this phone is that it can take up as much as 7hrs for a full 100% with the charger given in the box. Many people complain about the phone's heating up issue, yes it does heat up, however any phone with a large display heats up. Other than that the phone is great and should be bought if your considering to. p
malo n
good cellphone, work in venezuela with movilnet p
The phone performed with difficulty, freezes very frequently n

Excelente p
Delivery time, packaging, product quality is as expected, I liked the product, grateful to his attention by my rerror chose one band 3G phone which does not work for Movistar in Venezuela p
The software runs very slow and the screen is too small. While it works well for my Chinese sim card(CMCC). n
Nearly ideal for my needs, especially the compact size, good feature set and relatively current OS (compatible with most newer apps). Battery life could be better, but not a problem for me.Also, this phone apparently was originally made for an international market, so the charger supplied has a European plug; I had to replace the furnished (not-too-good) US adapter with a more reliable one. p
This phone is not as I expected. The resolution is disappointing especially for videos, it's horribly pixelated . I also had a bad experience when the product instructions tell you right off the bat to charge the phone before you do anything else, so I charged it a full two days, without any response from the phone. I later found out they had not cared to inform customers to remove the plastic lining from the battery in the instructions. A mishap on the manufacturer's or HTC's part. Also, when I finally first turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, and some text still stay in Chinese even after I changed the setting to English, I'm still not fond of the huge foreign charger with adapter that came with the phone. This phone was also not sent to me within 3-5 business days of ordering, which was when I needed it before my trip. I also saw this phone online now for a lesser price and twice the storage. Not only that, but the seller was also upsetting when I told them I wanted to return the phone, they rudely said they were going to charge me a ridiculous restocking fee of 30% not including the shipping and handling fees to return the phone. I would not recommend this phone nor the seller to anyone. I would actually advise people to avoid buying from this seller if you don't want to be ripped off. L2D2Online was the seller name I dealt with. Now I really regret my choice of buying this phone and from this seller. n
Just bring back the original HTC flashlight with super bright and dim feature. p
So glad I switched from an iphone to this one. p
Phone came defective out of box. n
veryyy nice phone p
I bought the phone around 3 months ago and have been using it so far. It is an amazing device, the camera quality is exceptional. The phone is pretty amazing, its fast, its nice to touch and feel, a lot of my friends told me it looked very nice. The software is pretty good. Now here is what is wrong with it. I wanted to give it 4.5 stars, but since amazon won't let me do that, i gave five. DO NOT UPGRADE to Android 5.2 or 5.1 or whatever. It will slow the device down drastically. After the upgrade I've had frozen screens, lagging games, frozen browsers etc etc. If you don't upgrade to the newest version of Android, its definitely worth it and also I don't know what is wrong with the seller, I got it for $474 three months ago, the price that they've mentioned right now is too much ($525). Do not go for it. At&t will sell this for $450, but I hate At&t, so I had to buy it here. Also, sometimes the device feels like its too big for your hands and may fall off, I've had it slip a lot of times. You might want to buy this only if your hands are big enough. The display is fantastic, the sound quality is superb and overall an amazing phone ruined by a stupid android upgrade. p
The phone is new.the only one problem is the battery life it' sucks. I have to charge it twice a day. n
Great phone!!!! everything works well. My only complaint is the battery life. Other than that the phone is perfect! p
I'm very satisfied with my purchase. p
No complaints at all. Phone came factory unlocked, brand new, same color, just like I ordered and at a great price. Shipping say fast and free. Can't say enough about how satisfied I am. I would recommend anybody buying a phone to buy from this seller. A++ p
The phone is unlocked and new.No complains at all. The only observation is, that my phone language was set in chinese but you can change that in 2 seconds.The first time you open your phone press the upper middle button on the screen and that will take you to language selection.Great phone p
Really nice phone. p
Excellent seller. No complain at all. I recomend p
Pretty smartphone p
GOOD PRODUCT p
Fast shipping. Good quality p
I've had the phone almost a week and I love it. 4G works perfectly on AT&T. The front camera is beautiful. It also survived an accidental drop from about 3 feet onto cement while waiting for the case to come. p
I love it so much. p
Ahead of time delivery. Great phone. p
Best phone ive had up to date! p
Wonderful Cellphone p
Good phone, the way both camera works suck but its alright p
great p
This phone reminds me of why HTC is the only brand for me. Not exactly the best selfie camera ever, but the main camera is beyond amazing! It came unlocked so all I had to do was cut down my present sim card and go! I love it! p
It's the best product on the market for such a reasonable price. Seems like a give away from HTC. Commendations to HTC for putting the customers first, unlike other companies who only look out for their profits. p
Bought this phone in January 2016was supposed to be new. The digitizer failed 8 months in. HTC says no warranty, so took it to a repair place. They opened it up, and turns out, not only was the screen replaced previously, it's a D++ grade. Basically as crappy as you can get before it fails. I'm furious!!! Perhaps the phones are good, but totally misrepresented. n
I bought this lovely handset from Magic Mobile Partners on Dec. 27th 2015 and by April 27th 2016 ( 4 months later) the phone just would not turn on. Spoke to the store about it said my device was no longer under warranty and I had no remedies available. It worked fabulously for the 4 month period. It still looks like a brand new phone yet it wont work. Sought out some sort of discount for buying the exact same handset again but I was turned down. It is a great phone at a great price but no one buys a phone and is pleased after it goes dead after 4 months for no reason at all. Would've appreciated better service from the store I bought it from but hey business is business and I'd advise others to carry their's elsewhere buy from another store. :) n
Honestly love this phone! Perfect for Venezuela. Camara is amazing and on both sides...afted added memory, its comprable to my Iphone 6 as far as what is offered!! p
The selling point of this phone is two 13 mega pixel cameras. Don't be fooled. The cameras are absolutely horrible. The focus is horrible. The colors are terrible. It takes better pictures with the front camera than the back. I find myself on turning my screen away from me and shooting photos with the front camera just to get by. Horrible color/hue/saturation. Don't buy this phone. n
The phone looks beautiful from the very first glance, and it is water resistant. The rear camera is good but the front-facing one is not. It works smoothly, but no Marshmallow update yet, dont know why. p
Be warned... There is no warranty on at least some of these phones. HTC claims my phone was purchased almost a year before I actually purchased it, and HTC wants an original receipt that includes the IMEI and Serial Numbers, none of which are provided with purchase, so even though the phone was technically OEM "new", it is apparently being re-sold as a new phone. I will change this review to 5 stars if HTC/seller resolves this issue, since the phone, when working, is quite good, but the warranty problems are a deal breaker. n
Absolutely love this phone, even got one for my girlfriend as well. The image quality is the best and the front camera is the best. Thank You :-) p
Good phone. Auto setting on camera makes pictures yellow tinted, have to manually change it to landscape every time i want to take a picture. Pictures are clear though, have gotten compliments on the quality of the pics especially the front facing camera. I have experienced a few freezes. Otherwise thoroughly enjoying it. p
There is no headphone n
Received the phone a day earlier which was awesome...the phn is amazing, the camera quality is great however it kinda sucks at times in dark areas p
I've had quite a few cell phones over the years and this is my favorite so far. I actually got this same model phone a year ago through AT&T's next plan which means I made payments on the phone every month. 4 months later I dropped it and shattered the screen and of course had no insurance. I have been using my boyfriends Samsung Galaxy S5 Active since then and all I wanted was my HTC again. I'm actually a fan of the galaxy phones but having used the HTC Desire Eye before hand I noticed a lot of things about the Samsung that were frustrating for me. I've done a lot of research on phones looking for the features that I want and this HTC is it. So when I found it on Amazon unlocked for $230, it was the best deal anywhere. What I love about this phone are the pictures and the speakers. Both cameras on this phone are amazing and I take a lot of pictures so that was important. I also watch a lot of videos on my phone, which was frustrating on the Samsung because the speaker is small and on the back so I was always cupping the back of the phone trying to hear. This one has speakers in the front so anytime I'm trying to listen to anything on the phone I can hear it loud and clear. The screen is big and the shape of the phone is light and fairly thin and I like the way it feels in my hand. I mean, I like this phone so much I've bought it twice now! p
Cellular radio inside phone did not work n
It works great! The chips in the back bug me though p
Phone came in untouched condition, on time and works very well. Love this phone! p
Great, I want one more . Just very small use, I was expecting more use , because was a very low price compare with others use cellplhones. p
My front flash had a little crack. p
Battery life is low n
10\10 p
Love it p
She loves it. Like you would expect it takes great pics. p
Wonderful phone, cases are hard to come by, if willing to invest some money in a great case btw look up DevilCase. But functions perfectly and the cameras are very nice, only reason for 4 stars is that AT&T isn't the best around my area. p
Does not work unless you have AT&T service. Yes it is unlocked, but with T-mobile, pictures could not be sent or received through the service. The T-mobile guys tried for almost an hour trying to get it working correctly, but it just couldn't be done. n
It's a good phone. p
Great phone. Yep, it has bloat ware on it but I disabled what I didn't want. No big deal. Like I wrote - great phone and am glad I bought it. I am using att. Slipped Sims in it and it was up and running. Did not have to setup an apn on it. Other users not using att will have to. Easy to do, just Google it or your provider will have info on it. p
Phone is really awesome. Sounds is outstanding. But it is not unlocked, it is really hard to make an APN for other carrier. p
Everything great!!! p
I ordered this phone and it shows on the description that it is GSM unlocked. I activated SIM with Ultra mobile , its started working but data plan is not working , i called customer service they said that phone seems not be fully unlocked , Please let me know if any suggestion. n
I LOVE THIS PHONE IT IS My baby. The phone is great,but I was having a little trouble with the mobile data and the messaging because I didn't have at&t I have T-Mobile, but after i looked up some settings on Google my phone worked great. Oh and it has this cool power saver setting that, really works. Also once your phone's battery gets below a certain percentage you won't be able to use the flash. Oh and the camera is great I enjoy it but when it comes to using it on other apps like snapchat and Instagram It doesn't look as good because you don't have access to all the camera features from your phone. But that's it the phone is amazing tho. And if you are really considering this phone look at YouTube videos and other reviews outside of amazon p
Nice phone, Nice seller. p
Awsome p
Ordered this phone a week ago and I absolutely love it! It is so much faster than any phone I've ever had. The camera is also brilliant. It hasn't froze or had to force close anything. I used mine with straighttalk. p
To say I love this phone is an understatement. I was concerned it may to big but it isn't. Actually I enjoy it being a bit larger than other phones. By comparison it is a bit smaller the the iphone 6+. Vibrant screen color, solid phone. Android apps are plentiful. This was a great deal. p
Had my phine for three months now and the phone worked good at first great camera. I could not receive pictures but recently my camera stopped working and two days later the screen just went black. I had to do a factory reset as a last resort i lost everything. I gave it a day and it went black again im highly upset this is supposed to be a brand new phone . I would not recommend it for long term use n
Phone works perfrcly with T-mobile with the exception of MMS. Internet and SMS work flawlessly but after trying to configure the APN settings a few times and speaking with a T-mobile rep, there's no fix. Sometimes unlocked phones just won't do MMS (it's the #1 issue). Other than that, camera is beautiful, no lag so far and I take it in the shower everyday for music! p
Looks like a nice phone, too bad I can't use it because it's att and it only takes a micro sim. It was supposed to be unlocked and it said nothing about the micro sim n
Worked great. Excellent product!!!! p
An underrated phone that has a lovely screen, fast and smooth operation, front facing speakers for quality audio playback, and a good camera. I also like the material chosen for the construction of the phone, which is like a smooth, high quality matte plastic. My only gripe would be the physical size of the phone compared to its screen size, but I understand that this is due to the large selfie camera, which is something that I don't need. p
Mobile is good but baterry is not good finesh arely. n
I dislike this product because you can buy the same cel phone almost at half of the price n
Very nice phone with very nice features. Very fast, great front and main cameras. Just wish I could get the AT&T features off. Good value for money p
Great cellphone p
I loved this phone for the brief time I owned it. The camera alone was worth it for me. I sent it back because it came with a Nano Sim card p
PROS: I bought the phone for its great camera and audio features (actual it was a gift given to me). CONS: the battery does not seem to keep its charge. I am not sure if it is because on a daily basis there are up to 15 to 20 apps always being automatically updated. And, unfortunately, I can't delete these unused apps from my phone. Also, the mic on the phone can't be seen at night. The mic should also have its own key, not combined with the "period." It's annoying to hit "OK" everytime I enter my password. It is an unnecessary key stroke. I find the phone to be to big for my small hand. n
Bought this phone as a selfie phone because it has the dual 13MP cameras. It does work nicely as a front facing selfie camera with a really good wide angle camera and front facing flash, however the software is not done well as it switches easily to video capturing and that causes first world problems for me going back and forth to change the camera back (need to be extra careful with how you hold the phone and what you say so it does not switch). Pictures turn out okay but my Nexus 5x was able to produce better pictures (using HDR mode) in almost all lighting conditions. p
Purchased two of these phones. Both worked fine until one of them stopped charging recently. Good midrange phone, unfortunately one was a dud n
excellent... p
very good p
The phone was new and quite exceptional for the price, but advertising as UNLOCKED just to receive it and see that it's GSM LOCKED is a pain in the ass. You won't be able to turn S-On off, unless you pay 25$, and even then, you have to go through a painful process to unlock the bootloader, root, S-OFF and install a custom ROM just to get rid of the sh/t AT&T bloatware. The device is great, but I'm going to return it while I'm still on time to do it. It was for my mom but is locked on AT&T. n
Use it for a while now. So far so good. Only one major problem is can not use for hot spot because the staff who work at T-mobile said it's a AT&T phone. Be careful with that. n
Phone doesn't work at all! I had to rotate the phone in order to be able to use the touch screen..Returned it the next day ,so disappointing! n
Very good p
No this device didn't meet my expectations. This website has officially made me uncomfortable to but electronics. This is the second time I have ordered something electronic claiming to be unlocked and they aren't. Waste of 200$. And a major waste of my time n
Really good phone! The benefits are truly amazing! And IT'S UNLOCKED LIKE THE ADVERTISEMENT SAYS.Watch a youtube review for all it's PRO's and CON's. And when you search for the specifications and frequency bands, search for the AT&T version of the phone, that's the one being sold...In my personal experience with the product, just had some cons...Cons:- Didn't bring earphones.- Battery last 1 day of not using it that much.- 16GB of internal memory, with almost 9GB useful...- It's AT&T VERSION: * FULL OF AT&T APPS (not able to erase them without root or another rom). * Interface dedicated to AT&T. The phone is still useful and everything, but might be an unconfortable start if you don't want a thing with AT&T... * Still hasn't being updated to android 6.0.1, and kind of need it...- Personal stuff: * Bigger than i thought: This was my bad, but check it before you buy. * To venezuelan people, Digitel will only give you EDGE. Movistar will let you go full 4G. I misread in my search and now have to change my number... Would've bought other phone to keep my Digitel service, or expanded my search without caring about frequency bands...Even with all that stuff behind, I'm pretty satisfied with my new phone. :) p
it been just 7 months and there is a big spot on my screen n
Received this phone on the 16, let me tell this phone is too of the line I love it like cooking food, the camera is phenomenal I can't stop taking selfies. The features are very great,the shape, I love where the speakers are everything is just great with phone I have no complaints or faults with it.Look at how great it took a picture of my friends back yard ðŸ˜ p
nice phone for the price,i love it p
I seriously like the phone. The size, the speed, the cameras. Everything except that it is an AT&T branded phone and is locked to AT&T. This is advertised as a GSM unlocked device and it is not. AT&T doesn't offer service in my area so this phone is useless. When I contacted AT&T they said this phone was under contract and an unlock code could not be given. I even contacted the seer and they said I would have the unlock code within a few days. I am still awaiting their response and I have se t a second email complaint. Buyers beware. n
It's delivered like 5 days in advance or so. I ordered on October 3rd and received it on 5th. Amazing job! I just loved the phone as well. It's super smooth and fast. Battery and memory are the only minuses but you can't beat this price with better specs. So it's worth every penny! Don't hesitate to shop with them or buy this phone if you are looking something works just awesome and economic, you're on the right spot. p
Excellent. SIM card easily switched out from IPhone. p
Love my new phone,delivery was fast and on time thank you Izzy p
I was concerned about getting a lower end phone but this one has done the job and I have noticed no significant drawbacks. Camera is pretty grainy and takes a long time to focus, so if you're wanting to use it as your main camera I would look elsewhere. p
Is a very good phone and exceeds my expectations. p

Received the unlocked version as mentioned. Package includes the mobile, charger(not the QC 2.0 charger even though the mobile is QC 2.0 supported) and HTC sync cable (3ft). The mobile itself is working great, no hangs. BoomSound is really awesome. It runs on Android 5.0.2 lollipop with Sense 6.0Downside : No headphones, lots of At&t built-in apps, camera is worse. p
I live in Costa Rica and bought this phone a couple of weeks ago to (((ApptronicsStore)))) I do not recommend the store at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I wait for the phone for loooooong...The first thing I noticed when opening the box, was that the charger came without packaging ITS VERY CLEAR THAT THE CHARGER IS USED!!! It is not the first HTC I bough! When tried the charger the screen showed a message saying "please charge you phone with the original HTC charger" THE CHARGER DOES NOT WORK!!! Im VERY UPSET bcz the phone is beautiful.UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT ALL the phone came scratched on the back and the screen does not work properly, EVERY time I unlock the screen displays lines as if it had hit. Im really sad and upset. The phone is amazing but I BOUGHT A NEW PHONE!!! and received one used or refurbished... I am extremely disappointed!I sent a message to the seller and says he can change the product.. ok GOOD! so if I want the phone for which I paid... I should then pay all shipping costs to send it and then to bring it back to Costa Rica AGAIN????? THAT'S BULLS***I'm too unhappy and upset, the phone is incredible but with a screen that does not work and without charger I do not know what to do with the phone. MYPARANA STORE (the best seller) did not have it available at that time so I made the mistake of buying it in ApptronicsStore.The phone is unique but make sure you are buying to the right people. n
The phone worked great for the first month and a half. Now it won't charge on any charger and is a plastic brick. What is the warranty coverage for this phone? n
Excelent relation quality vs price p
This is an awesome phone. Big screen, powerful guts, beefy cameras. And it's water resistant. It's wonderful.Take note, however, that the plastic on the sides and back is REALLY SLIPPERY. Like, obscenely slippery. I tried using this phone to type something on Facebook in bed, and it kept slipping out of my hands and hitting me in the face. It was kind of comical. p
The phone is great with this price.Very recommended and shipping was fast also.Thanks for seller. p
I'm very please with the product having a blast with it you guys won't regret one bit p
Excelente p
thank you so much for your honesty and commitment to deliver the phone, it's as you shown a new and complete working with GSM networks p
This phone is 100% unlocked . It is an AT&T phone so it has their info on it but i had no problem with the cricket set up for the phone. It is my first HTC so i'm still trying to figure somethings out with the camera features but so far ... Absolutely GREAT phone. runs smooth no freezing or staling . handles all the many apps i've downloaded and the pictures are awesome for a phone .. Not to mention it came super quick. p
Best phone out there for $200.Front and back camera are equally good.Waterproof without having to open any flap to charge the phone. p
Me liky this phone p
AWESOME p
Best phone I've ever had! fast, easy to use and perfect size! I'm from Costa Rica and it works perfectly fine here! :-) p
By far the best android phone I have ever ownedEDIT: Tried to transfer phone service to TMobile and phone is LOCKED to AT&T. LOCKED PHONE n
Great phone! It is unlocked, and I use it with Net10 so it's perfect for me. It does everything it's supposed to, so I'm happy. I love the cameras. p
This is an AT&T phone with less than 8gigs of storage. The 16 gig rating is before htc, google and android fill it with bloatware and lock it. This would be fine if the phone allowed apps to completely store on the external sd card, but that's not the case. Many apps are denied permission to write on the external card at all, so other than music, movies and pictures that do store on the ext sd card, this really is a phone with less than 8gigs. So i need to uninstall big apps before updating others. It's crazy.Other than that, the phone is a typical android. Nothing special or awful. The Camera is a little overated, but it is good. The selfie camera is obviously way better than most phones. If you go places with just you and your kids, this works out. I hike with my one young son and it's nice to finally get a quality picture. n
Its really good one p
So far, I love it! Upgraded from a HTC desire 610. p
Great Phone for the price, really nice design, screen is a little bigger than I like but just a taste thing.At first I doubt to buy this one as I live in Mexico and this was an AT&T Unlocked, not sure if this will work as there was some comments about the 4G Network issues.After reading a couple of reviews I take a shot and BUM, I had problems with the mobile network also.After spending some hours figuring out and reading post I finally get "Mobile Data" working in Mexico under Telcel network. This may bethe same resolution for other countries although.BE WARE: Mobile HotSpot DOWS NOT WORK. As this is an At&T Unlocked, seems that i has some block from AT&T to activate Hotspot with other carrier.I notice that there was no APN defined in this phone so I ask a friend to let me copy the settings of his APN and everything works. Basically what I did was:Go to ...."Settings" --> "Mobile Networks" --> "Access point names" --> Access the "Menu" --> "New APN".Copy the profile from other phone from the same company and start Working (no password required in my case).Save the APN and Mobile Data was immediately working.Hope this helps someone elseIm in Mexico and buy this phone in US.Hope this Helps somebbody else. p
This is good phone however I have experienced some problems these include the phone screen being somewhat easy to break I drop it once on its face albeit tile and it cracked however it has smoothed out and still works at the time of this review now compared to my phone before this the HTC one m7 which I dropped on its face all the time and never got a crack this is a lot easier to crack another issue I have is I cannot for the life of me use T-Mobile mobile hotspot I have tried so many ways and I have even tried 3rd party hotspot apps I just doesn't work however all in all this is a really good phone p
The person who I bought it for is in love with it. Great camera and features. p
Had a phone with only 4 gb so this one is great using trackfone so far so good think I well be very happy with it screen looks great p
I love this phone SO FAR. My only complain is that sometimes when I wake my phone up from sleep it seems to have like white interference on the screen as if the screen were busted. But it always goes away (so farrrrr) if i make it sleep and then wake it up. Other than that it's a really GREAT PHONE!!! The camera is great, it has flash on both ends, the screen looks good, it's fast. Idk it works well for my teenage self. another thing is that the weather application used to work on it but then it stopped idk why, its really annoying. also it keeps asking me for my location over and over again even though i give it to it. idk if thats the phone or what p
Phone keep crashing after 1 month of use n
the phone is amazing. better than expected. p
Cameras are great, and with marshmallow, phone no longer has storage issues. p
Very good very easy to use p
I've been an HTC fan for ever since the days of my HTC Evo. I presently own an HTC One M8. So, I may be a little biased.I bought the HTC Desire Eye E1 for my mother-in-law based on my previous experience with HTC and her limited budget. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the phone. I wasn't expecting "junk" by any means, but it was a much better value than I expected.The device feels sturdy and rugged. Additionally, it is aesthetically pleasing and has some really nice features over many other phones. One thing that sets this device aside from others is the front and back camera are both 13MP. This is a great feature for budget conscience social media enthusiasts. Also, if you're a little klutzy around the dinner table, this phone is water resistant as well. (I didn't test that out. I'm fairly certain mom-in-law will "field test" that feature soon enough.) I was a little hesitant about the 16GB ROM; however, you can configure the phone so all pics, movies, voice recordings, downloads, etc. are stored on the Micro SD by default. (Note: Not all apps can be moved to SD storage.)This phone performs well and has a good, clear picture for movies, games, etc. (I had to test it out for my mother-in-law.) The phone also has pretty decent sound quality as well.Overall, I'm very pleased with this phone. HTC Sense with Lollipop provides a good experience out of the box. Now, my wife and daughter want one also. And, hey! For $200, I can actually afford it.UPDATE: I purchased this phone for my wife shortly after I purchased the original. I just recently purchased the same for my daughter. My wife and daughter both love this phone. p
Its good except, I can't receive the multimedia messages and can't use hotspot on the phone. But picture wise, is the right phone for me. Thank you p
UGH I love this phone. The camera has been soo good to use, and the phone itself is smooth and reliable, a great size and really good looking. Super pleased. p
I was skeptical because I had an iPhone before this. I really wanted a galaxy note or s6 edge or iPhone 6s plus... but didn't wanna pay the crazy expensive price for a phone and I didn't wanna go back on a 150$ a month plan. Sooo I did some research and this phone was the closest I could find and with a price I was happy with paying. It is great almost as big as the 6s plus and bigger than the edge but not super huge. But it does make my iPhone 4s seem teeny tiny. But it's super fast takes great photos. Great selection of cases online and it's just a great phone. Currently using on net 10 p
Pros:Less Price*****13 MP Camera with Flash on front and back *****Excellent mobile for this price range. p
Beautiful screen, weeks with my MetroPCS SIM (can only be done in-store). Came in a fresh AT&T box, very happy. p
I have to say that I am very pleased with this product. It is easily one of the best phones I have ever owned. Definitely a five star for not only the product, but the actual delivery time itself. p
I love this phone with camera is the best!!! My friends like to used my phone to take a shot.This is the first time for me to head HTC phone p
Love this phone! Great buy & came in mint condition! Signed up with AT&T so connecting it was no problem. 5/5 no regrets. p
I bought this for my girlfriend. So far , she loves it . It takes great pictures and is very fast . We both use straight talk. Once you set up the APN , it works great.

front camera is excellent !!finish is also good. p
Excellent p
Poweful with a great looking display. I have taken a few pictures and not experienced any flaws so far. The eye software is the best on the market and makes the phone fun to play with. Overall this phone gets my five rating for price and features. Get it while you can. p
beauty body, grip, good camera p
You sell me defect phone, voice button dont work and screen have dead pixel n
Amazing phone no defects I have had it for 2 days now an it works amazing great camera nice detail easy set up I have honestly no complaints :) p
This is a great phone. Very powerful and fast for this price point. I also want to dispel some of the conflicting reviews, questions and comments here regarding its operation on T-Mobile's network. Yes, this is an AT&T branded phone, however it is not locked. Just pop your T-Mobile sim card in and you're good to go. I get 4G LTE and full functionality on the T-Mobile network. The phone has the capability; If you are having trouble, it may be a settings problem (access point), or you may not be in a good reception area. For example, I I only get 4G and not LTE in my living room. But out on the street, I get LTE.UPDATE: I am having problems with MMS and WIFI Hotspot. MMS works, but only if you turn WIFI off. Haven't been able to use Hotspot at all - T-Mobile says it is due to AT&T software installed on the phone. I will contact HTC to see if they can help. p
I am SO dissapointed with this phone. I know HTC it's a really good brand and I just dont know what's going on.First, the materials are really good, it feels solid and it is definetely water proof.But everytime I use the phone it crashes and freeze. ALL THE TIME. I tried to write this on the amazon app and just couldnt, it freezed and quit the app. I only use basic social networks and basic games like solitaire and sudoku, I dont even use heavy games or a lot of apps, I dont use a micro sd card either. The camera quality is average and it takes 2 seconds after I press the button to actually take the photo. I dont even need my money back, I just need a phone that WORKS.ALSO: The USB cable is just garbage, I have had the phone for 3 weeks and its not working. I have to move it a little until I find a position that charges the phone, this makes the battery go hot.Please just help me out with this. Edit: I'm back in my country and I just find out the PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED. n
Everything seems to work fine except my Facebook application. The videos don't always play and the app will just shut down. Also, if you're setting this phone up through Straight Talk, you have to go online and find the proper setup for the network or else you aren't mobily connected. n
well worth the price,it's compatible with the service providers in the Carribbean (Trinidad and Tobago - Digicel, Bmobile), battery life is adequate for moderate use, however the phone does get warm after about 1 hr and there are no headphones included. Overall very happy with my purchase. p
Having new phone regrets. Found that while the OS is upgradeable, the battery is not replaceable/removable. Also setup and transfer with AT&T contacts was a nightmare. p
Hi everyone after buying this phone for my wife as a Christmas present, she loved it. the only issue i had was the the 4G LTE connection. after taking the phone :( apart i was able to make a manual configuration to be able to connect to t-mobile and get a decent 4G LTE connection. the only way to get it to work is to make 4 APN customs lines, 2 MMC to receive, send text and media via Text Message and the other two for voice and data, believe me is not as bad as it sounds anybody can do it, Love the screen on this Phone and the HTC custom Android layout works great! p
Nice phone but it is LOCKED. Disappointed n
Best phone on a budget. p
I received this phone today.So far I like it. The only problem I have with the phone and I feel this is a big one.. The description claims that the phone is unlocked. The phone I received is NOT! I received an AT&T phone. Luckily, I was going to use it for Straight Talk so I could use an AT&T phone. That's why I'm not making a huge deal about this but you shouldn't advertise unlocked when it's not. p
I ordered this and it shows on the description that it is GSM unlocked. When we tried to open it it says it is locked in AT&T. It was a gift that I sent to Philippines. Now nobody can use it since we can't have it unlocked. Please resolve this issue asap n
There is no headphone n
I bought an HTC Desire Eye with my phone company about a year and a half ago and I absolutely loved it. I never had problems with it freezing up, the sound was great, it was the perfect size, and it took amazing pictures. My original phone got knocked off of an end table and the screen shattered, I was devastated. So, I got a new phone. Not an HTC but a Samsung Galaxy...I absolutely hated it. It was too small, got hot really fast, constantly froze up, the battery died too fast and it took way too long to recharge. I hated it. So for my last birthday I got me another HTC. It's been great, I have absolutely no complaints. I love it! p
Love this phone and the photo taking capability. That was one of the selling points. The pre-installed sms app was terrible though. It wouldn't send or receive any message over 1MB and when I went to adjust the settings on that I realized that was the maximum setting anyway. I installed a different texting app and now my only complaint with this phone is resolved. p
Stepped up to this after owning a Galaxy S3. No comparison as to speed, screen clarity and general performance. After doing a bit of research, I found this model is essentially an HTC M8 in a plastic body. So you're getting close to a flagship device for under $200. I paired it with a basic Cricket pay as you go plan and get the AT&T network also. This is a great solution if you are a senior adult and don't spend every waking minute bent over your device. Even if you did, I can see no difference performance-wise between the Eye and my wife's iPhone, except if the snob factor comes into play. Extremely satisfied with this device and would purchase it again. p
I luv the phone but for some reason I can't turn off the vibrating notifications...I have went through every setting on my apps and turned the notifications off but the phone still vibrates at night n
Awesome phone. I have been using it for the past 4 months. Not many 4G bands but works good for AT&T. p
I purchased this product less than a year ago - worst telephone ever. Was open , was locked , was not updated. Battery drains every 3 hrs ... n
Thanks HTC p
I love it. It is a great cellphone. p
excelent p
Great phone. Works great. Fantastic value. p
Best phone I've had!! It's waterproof, the front led flash surprises people and I've had so many people amazed by this phone, if you want a phone that nobody has and is definitely top-notch, this is it. I highly recommend it p
I ordered a case at the same time I ordered this phone. Every now and then I could not help taking the phone out of the case to admire the look and built of the phone. With the IPX7 dust and water resistant, this phone by far is the best of all I have used, I refunded the other HTC phone I had because of some overheating issues, and got this one instead. This phone is really dust proof and fingerprint proof. It has a matte feel to the phone thus do not attract fingerprints like the glossy plastic body. It has a clear crisp display and very visible under the sun as well. I am a fan of IPS touch display phone instead of AMOLED display, because i owned phones with AMOLED displays and they just make my eyes so uncomfortable. I love the functionality in the phone. There were some HTC preloaded apps but they are not annoying and are actually useful. I do not like when a phone comes with all pre-installed apps which take up so much space and cannot be removed. I love the Blinkfeed feature which keeps me up to date with news around the world. This phone is labelled as the 'ultimate selfie phone', but I am not really a selfie fan. The camera is decent but a little under-performed especially in indoor setting. HTC phones does not skimp on one feature in order to boost another feature and it is an all-around phone. When you pay so much for a phone you would expect so much from HTC. Good phone, no complaints! p
Love it great phone switch from an iPhone and was kind of hesitant but the phone is awesome great battery life and easy to use. p
Excellent phone! , excellent seller! p
My husband loves this phone so much as much as I do (different color) and he has figured out more than I have, he loves the quality of the camera, as it has a selfie (front camera) and photo booth style, also has beauty fix which makes ypur skin look better and pretty much fixes you if you'd like.Also it has the option to hide apps if you don't use them is good to have. Speaker is in front which makes it easier to hear when you turn on the speaker which has helped me to talk while driving.I like it is a thin phone and decent screen size for our taste. Just love it. p
Fantastic phone p
Amazing love it!!!! p
I love this phone, stunning look! p
Excellent (: p
This is one of the greatest phones I've had! The front facing camera is amazing!!!! It also comes in handy with its waterproof abilities. p
Use is not intuitive. n
I've had the HTC Desire EYE 4G LTE for about a month now and I love it the camera is awesome p
It was some scratches (one of them is 1 inch long on the top of the screen) with a glass protection screen its invisible, some drop marks in the corners but it runs perfectly.I got it in less time that i expected and i got what i bought.Personal score: 4.5. p
Nice and fast the telephone is good :) p
I love the phone. It is amazing. The pictures are great. The speed is awesome. Everything was perfect.I have tmobile. So what I didn't like is that I couldn't get my internet or mms. I called tmobile and they helped me to get internet. And entered an APN code to work. With the MMS they didn't know what to do. I had to research myself and made it work.But beside all that. Now everything works. Super happy with my phone! p
Great cellphone p
This is a great phone. The size of it will take some getting used to since it is on the larger side of the spectrum. After a month or two though, I've grown accustomed and now other phones just seem small to me.The front facing camera is a true joy, and I'm the only one I know who has bought it so far. That's a plus for me since I hate to have the same as everyone else. The only thing preventing me from giving it a 5 star review is that the sound isn't as impressive as I was expecting it to be, but maybe my expectations were a little too lofty. It does still sound better than my previous phone though. Also, the small size of the side bezel also makes accidental touching of the screen while holding a bother too but these are all minor issues. I noticed recently however that my headphone jack stopped working. I thought the headphones were the problem but it's definitely the port. I'm not sure why, maybe it was due to something on my part, but the phone never dropped or anything so I'm not sure what it could've been.UPDATETurns out that the headphones were the problem and the phone remains in proper working order. Misdiagnosis on my part. p
Excellent phone,I love it... p
AWESOME.. I just loved it.. p
She loves it. Like you would expect it takes great pics. p
Wonderful phone, cases are hard to come by, if willing to invest some money in a great case btw look up DevilCase. But functions perfectly and the cameras are very nice, only reason for 4 stars is that AT&T isn't the best around my area. p
Does not work unless you have AT&T service. Yes it is unlocked, but with T-mobile, pictures could not be sent or received through the service. The T-mobile guys tried for almost an hour trying to get it working correctly, but it just couldn't be done. n
It's a good phone. p
Great phone. Yep, it has bloat ware on it but I disabled what I didn't want. No big deal. Like I wrote - great phone and am glad I bought it. I am using att. Slipped Sims in it and it was up and running. Did not have to setup an apn on it. Other users not using att will have to. Easy to do, just Google it or your provider will have info on it. p
Phone is really awesome. Sounds is outstanding. But it is not unlocked, it is really hard to make an APN for other carrier. p
Everything great!!! p
I ordered this phone and it shows on the description that it is GSM unlocked. I activated SIM with Ultra mobile , its started working but data plan is not working , i called customer service they said that phone seems not be fully unlocked , Please let me know if any suggestion. n
I LOVE THIS PHONE IT IS My baby. The phone is great,but I was having a little trouble with the mobile data and the messaging because I didn't have at&t I have T-Mobile, but after i looked up some settings on Google my phone worked great. Oh and it has this cool power saver setting that, really works. Also once your phone's battery gets below a certain percentage you won't be able to use the flash. Oh and the camera is great I enjoy it but when it comes to using it on other apps like snapchat and Instagram It doesn't look as good because you don't have access to all the camera features from your phone. But that's it the phone is amazing tho. And if you are really considering this phone look at YouTube videos and other reviews outside of amazon p
Great phone! It is unlocked, and I use it with Net10 so it's perfect for me. It does everything it's supposed to, so I'm happy. I love the cameras. p
I love it. Perfect! p
i love it p
Bought the phone for my daughter she loved it.this phone has an amazing camera.the pictures come out beautiful. p
The build quality is not the best. The phone was advertised with a selfie camera that was supposed to be good. The camera does not meet expectations and is well below mediocre. Does not feel nice when using it either n
Excelent p
What a nice phone p
one of the best phone I have used so far. value for money. p
Does not support LTE on AT&T n
It is a great phone. Front camera has high pixels. Enjoying it. p
The phone doesn't have Arabic language n
Good p
One of the best.Love it.Will not change it for an another model. p
I am yet to receive my phone despite you said it was left in the mailbox it is not there and i want a refund or a replacement. Item of such value should be signed for i am very disgruntled and will not allow this to take place. n
love my phone p
Great product excellent dealer p
nice phone p
Works good,no issues. p
Recommeded p
The phone is fine and works fine but the plug is broken so I can not charge my phone now and I have notice any other plug I have does not work either. That is the reason it got a 3 star it would of gotten 5 if the plug still work n
I was fascinated this article high quality and unique design. p
So I recently purchased this phone from the seller Breed, and had it shipped by Amazon and I must say, I was pretty nervous about it because of all the bad reviews about getting the wrong phone and stuff. But I got my phone, it was brand new! and I'm really loving it! It's sleek, and the camera quality is unbelievably awesome! The quad-core makes this phone really easy to use and doesn't slow up. This phone was definitely a great purchase! p
I and my friends bought this phone. But all phones have same problems. Firstly we can't use phone as HOT SPOT even though I tried it in different locations and with diffirent cellulars. Second problem, when the battery decreases %15 it automatically open GPS. It is expected to do just opposite to save battery. I contacted amazon and seller about these issues. They kept directing me eachother. Finally I fed and gave up. n
I ordered this phone twice trying to give it a second chance because I was getting it as a gift. The first time I ordered this the phone came in a used box with the HTC sticker and an iPhone 4 sticker. Not only this, but the box contained a used iPhone 4!!!! I was extremely disappointed. The second time I ordered the phone the box was empty! Please be aware, there seems to be people who have had great experiences though. n
I was expecting to receive a phone no a solar battery!!! I can't believe .... n
Received an iPhone 4S 8GB white instead of the HTC. n
I received an iPhone 4 instead of the HTC n
I ordered and received an unlocked AT&T version of the phone last week Thursday. I really like this phone, everything about it is wonderful. It's good for games, music, the front and back camera is nice, the phone Mic is good for calls, good signal strength and handy, and works well with other SIM aside from AT&T. The only issue with the phone is the battery. I think for a phone of this functionality, HTC should have given it a better battery life.The seller claimed that the phone has been upgraded to Android 6.0 Marshmallow but this is not true, the phone has a Android Lollipop. This should be corrected and in fairness, an update should be made available for those of us that have purchased the phone in the US so we can also enjoy the Android 6.0 Marshmallow on the HTC Desire Eye.I would have given it a 5 star but for the battery life and misrepresentation on the Android version running on the phone.Albeit, I'm enjoying the phone. n
Excelent p
Couldnt wait tell this to come love this phone no problems at all so far and this my second desire eye if you thinking about getting this phone I highly recommend this phone cause I love it and if I love it you will love it ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š p
The phone is absolutely perfect, even though the phone is locked by AT&T.The phones specs are so amazing. p
The Htc Desire eye from AT&T is a selfie takers dream phone. The front camera takes the best pictures I have seen. I am surprised this phone wasn't more popular. I have used it for approx a week now and it runs very smooth.The phone I purchased was a Used one and I am using it in Canada on the Rogers Lte Network. p
Receive my package right on time. Enjoying the phone the only downside is the wifi wont connect. n
I recently bought this phone and it's the best the camera quality is great no problems so far I recommend y'all to get this phone my girl got a iPhone 6 but now want one of these p
The phone arrived used with the screen falling off it was over heating as well n
Excelente p
As someone who has owned and handled several Galaxies (4,5 & 6) and handled iPhones I can say this phone definitely stacks up. It performs just as well if not better in certain aspects. Software and apps respond quickly and software is up to par with the Samsung and iPhone. Also the front facing camera with HDR takes your selfies to a glorious level. Pics are crisp, clear and amazing. The speakers aren't as amazing as the camera, though, but if you're like me and mostly listen with headphones or an external speaker anyway, it doesn't really matter. Screen resolution is beautiful and crisp as well. I have had phone about 2 months already and I love it! p
Very good self-photo phone and it is cheaper than Samsung! My wife loves it! p
Legitimately not happy with the quality, I've had the cover for about a month and already its chipping off the edges and tearing. Not what I had anticipated at all. n
Great phone for the money loads fast camera is good only downside is the size of the phone its quite large in a case. p
Okay as a quick overview:1) First time in my life got an amazon prime delivery late2) This phone is not fully unlocked and does not work with T-mobile3) It is heavy for its size and behind in software and hardware technology4) The worst configuration of battery/sim slots I have ever seen with two separate entry points and covers which thereafter do not fit properly once you remove them.In all, I'm returning this product. Epic fail HTC. n
phone is a very fast and easy to use perfect jobThe only thing is that you can upgrade to the latest versions of ics 4.0.4 can only use the old 2.3.6 p
I really like this phone so far, It slightly exceeded my expectations! A pleasant surprise, as always. It's a pretty quick phone, and since it's unlocked I got to teach myself how to mess with the APN settings. (I panicked at first, but it ended up not being a big deal.) Nice big screen, very responsive. The only issues I have is that I had no idea what color of this phone I was getting, they come in brown, and occasionally black. I couldn't find anywhere in the description what color I was getting! I didn't care one way or another about the color so it wasn't a big deal, but I still wouldn't have minded knowing. (It was brown, for the record.) My only other issue is that the dumb headset that comes with it is kind of.....broken. KIND OF. I have to twist the headset cord a certain way to get audio through both ear buds. I can replace the headset for not very much though, so not a big deal, but still kind of disappointing. Other than those two issues, I'm really enjoying my new toy!! p
I got exactly what I bought. The phone is in very good condition and it works internationally. I got the charger, phone covers, and headphones. Thank you. p
Excellent design, not too big, very handy, fast and HTC Sense is really the best Android suite i ever used. p
This is my sixth phone and owned a Sony Ericsson X10 Mini Pro, but glad that i am changing. My decision to buy a HTC was right. I would recommend this phone. I am now eagerly waiting for the ICS update which is scheduled in July or August time-frame. p
It is beautiful, fast touch screen, very nice, it's a "Cellpad". The only difference between a iPhone and this HTC is the warranty. I have a lot of things that is from apple. The warranty/customer support made the difference. Apple just replace without putting you on the "bandit" side. Warranty from HTC is not international, have a lot of "Limitations". I have mine one for almost an year and it does not connect to the computer through the cable (they said it's the hardware). That's it. n
Excellent product. Highly recommended.HTC DESIRE HD has great technology, a lot of applications and an excellent operating system. Android works perfectly, the touch screen is amazing with high resolution and definition. p
I currently live overseas and cell phones can be quite expensive. Since I am in the military, the contract route wasn't an option and they don't exactly have "military clauses" on the contracts here in Europe for us. The wife was really wanting an iPhone 4, but I couldn't see spending $900 or so for a phone. However, we did stumble across an HTC phone display here and I really liked what I saw when we picked up the HTC Desire HD. I spent a lot of time comparing between this and the Samsung Galaxy. The Galaxy was similiary priced at the time and had a beautiful display, but felt cheap when compared to the solidily designed Desire HD.I personally haven't used the phone much, but the wife absolutely loves it.I do have one complaint about the phone. The battery cover doesn't seem to slide back on right after you intially install the battery. The factor condition of the phone can't be replicated when you reinsert the cover. It's no biggie, since we have it in a cover. However, it was one of those things that irked me considering how much money we spent on it. p
I have just received my HTC Desire HD, this is my third phone from HTC the last being HTC HD7. From its description the desire seemed to be another great phone from HTC however after two days of using it, I have different opinion because it constantly sticks to edge network even in areas with 3G network. As a result internet connection is painfully slow, while viewing internet videos is almost impossible (unless you have nothing else to do apart from waiting).This phone ought be different, it should be able to automatically select the best available network. n
Very slow delivery. The product was delivered almost one week after the supposed latest delivery date.Also, the camera function doesn't work, it takes me bucks to replace the camera although the product looks new.Very upset. n
The best handset i ever had from a functional point of view is really solid and stable. Very fast and the applications shipped with are great specially Ultra Sense.the only two not very good areas are:* the cover for the sim card and for the battery are very thing and delicate.* the battery may drain off very fast on heavy usage. If you have more than 2 bateries the problem with the covers arises as you have to change the battery constantly.* I could not find external chargers for additional batteries.Besides that is even better than an iPhone 4. p
I love this phone. It was shipped on time and it is exactly what I expected it to be. p
Fantastic on all aspects p
I bought this phone because I had the very same phone originally, and was delighted with it. I don;t normally write product reviews, but this phone was definitely not a HTC Desire S, it looks the same but it was in no way comparable to my original one. The screen works intermittently, sometimes it will work properly, sometimes if you rotate the screen it will work and sometimes if you turn the screen on and off again it will work. And this is just one thing, there are various other things like the speaker is always on by default when you're making a call and so on.Stay away from this phone. n
Great Mobile, lots of features, and I love the size. My wife and are traveling to Central and South America, and we were looking for something compact with lots of features! WELL THIS IS IT. We have since than recommended this mobile to several of our traveling mates, and family members. Thank you Amazon. p
Good night.WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I CAN HELP. BUY ONLINE THE HTC DESIRE, AND I CAN SET THE SPANISH LANGUAGE SINCE NO MELO ALLOWS ONLY HAVE IN ENGLISH AND JAPANESE.THANKS IN ADVANCE YOUR HELPTHANKSYSMENIA DIAZ p
I bought the phone 6 months ago and it never worked properly, I was never able to browse on the internet, even though my plan allowed it.Today I made my last attempt and took the phone to my mobile company (Claro Ecuador), the customer representative checked the device and told me the phone settings should allow me to navigate on the internet, but unfortunately the cellullar phone simply does not work as it should even though the device allows it. n
Beware, this is not compatible with AT&T 3G network. It is a European model, hence works on other frequencies than the two that AT&T use. In addition, I have returned the item after 1 day for the following reasons: it crashed every time i attempted a system update (seems a common enough occurence), it would not recognize my PC for syncing (despite all attempts and advice from user groups), it did not come withe micro-SD card that apparently has important software. It is a nice size, easy to use phone with a lot going for it, but those problems were too much. n
I bought this device from Wireovia about two weeks ago (end of November 2012). I had another one (bought from Europe) that I used for a few months before giving it to my wife and obviously I was happy with it since I bought another one.This particular device I got has quite an old software installed. It has Android 2.3.3 with HTC Sense 2.1 while the last version available is Android 2.3.5 and HTC Sense 3.0. It works as expected as a phone (signal strength, volume) but it could do more as a smart-phone (Android experience).From the first 5 minutes I enabled wireless it started downloading software updates. First it downloaded and successfully installed two FOTA updates. Immediately after that it tried to download a system update and this is where the 'trouble' begins. It successfully downloaded the 35MB system updated but it failed to apply it. I tried that a few times and it failed the same way every time. I asked Wireovia what to do and they told me to ask for support at HTC.I've just spent one hour on the line with HTC US support trying different stuff. They told me this particular device is an overseas (UK) version. They also told me that it looks like the phone it's trying to download the software update from their website but the update is not there and this is why it fails. I did not understand exactly what is it downloading since the update is not there but it still download some 35MBs. Anyway, if I want it updated I'd have two options: either wait for the update to become available on the website (don't know when that will happen) or send it to HTC so that they update it. Obviously the second option would cost me something (money - for shipping to them, time - since it's an overseas version they would have to ask for the update in the UK).The conclusion would be that there is a reason why there is no warranty available for this phone. Don't get me wrong: it's not like it's broken but it could do more for the same money. n
it was unlocked.as it was supposed to be...was new and sealed as it was described. Worked flawlessly. Gotta tove it. p
I bought this phone a month ago.Fortunatelly I've found a bargain and I've bought it ust for 160$.This phone is amazing for that price! Firt of all the 1 Ghz Qualcomm S2 and Adreno 205 GPU are enough for 95% of every task you can ask to your android phone (no 1080p video recording, just 720p with 5 Mpx camera). This phone has 768MB of ram that let you have a good multitasking. Display resolution is 800x480 and is really good for a 3,7" display, color are vivid and angle view are great (I think this display is IPS). As regard software, this phone comes with a android 2.3.3 and Sense 3.0. This rom is mediocre and a little laggy. You can update to the latest android 2.3.5 and Sense 3.0 that is a good rom and Everything is fine (but not excellent). If you're a power user I suggest you to install a custom rom with Android 4.0.3, believe me it makes the boost to your phone, excellent performance and low power consumption. Hardware accelleration with andreno 205 make android smooth as an iOS or a windows phone. If you're not a power users there's no problem because HTC is making an official update for your desire S!! So if you find a bargain with this phone, catch it up!!! p
I wish I had listened to the people complaining in here.Mine died within 3 weeks!!After looking around the internet I found several people with the same problem.Basically what happens is that if your phone crashes (software freezes for whatever reason), and if you try to remove the battery and re-insert it quickly the eMMC chip (internal memory) gets fried. Which is ridiculous, just proves how badly design HTC phones are.I found out too late that you can hold Vol. Up + Vol. Down + Power to reset it without removing the battery.To make things worse, since I live in Brazil and bought the phone during a trip to US, HTC Brazil is saying I'm not eligible to warranty claims! It doesn't matter to them if the phone has design flaws or not.I also never buying HTC products ever again. (and I'm not alone!)[UPDATE]Ok, HTC USA finally recognized that the phone was defective and replaced the main board under warranty. But they charged me $20 service fee because this phone that I bough on Amazon.com was originally intended for the India market and not the US.Not changing my review rate though, because after the repair the phone still presents some problems, as calls dropping and random crashes. n
The phone is really nice and user friendly but completely died and required a motherboard change for ~60% of its price after only two months of use. This is the first piece of electronics equipment that I buy in ages that had such a catastrophic failure on its own. I will never buy any HTC product again. n
Desire stands for Erotic and Lust, and that's what a Geek like me feels like when he puts his hands on a phone like this, the major beauty is in the inside says the grandmas and that's absolutely true when you play with this device, very fast processor and a lot of RAM to run your applications instantly with no lags, strong and reliable processor to rely on and keep your business apps, communications and mail running, and also is stylish and good looking, bright clear graphics and text to avoid tire your eyes, excelent signal reception, even for the cellular network, wifi, bluetooth and GPS, one word to describe the experience? AwesomenessAnd as usual in this type of devices, we would like to get longlasting batteries, when I use this phone at it's full capacity the battery just runs for about 6 hours and needs to be recharged again, so I always take with me a spare microUSB cable and the car charger to keep it running for the whole day. p
Nice phone , I use it for two months without any problem. But there is still one thing to say about its screen , under daylight you can almost see nothing , there is too much reflection. p
This wasn't the highest end phone of its time so not much to complain about. It came unlocked as stated and worked well out of the box without issues here in Ghana. n
it is a hoax , I sold a new cell , when used dna review this htc . CURIOUS GEORGE'S DECEPTION DECEPTION n
Best phone ever. But this replacement has issues. Big time. Went back reluctantly to the one with the broken screen ðŸ˜¨ n
Phone was not unlocked as advertised - sent it back - I'm waiting for the remedy?? n
Excellent! p
Excelente p
This is supposed to be an "upgraded" version of the rezound.. but the thing has more bugs than improvements. NOT the sellers fault(yes, I've researched online).. clearly HTC dropped the ball with this one. Everything from the sim card fault, to the keyboard bugs, loss of external memory, ect.. not recommending. By the rezound, or do what I'm about lo do, and go to Moto- less bloatware to lag what SHOULD be fast phones down. n
Good deal!! p
Excellent phone at great price very fast, excellent display quality and very light for the size, a curious thing is normal charge it's only achieved with original cable so be careful with it and don't loose it. p
The phone works great. My husband hasn't had any issues with and seems to really like the phone. Thanks so much p
This is my 4th droid phone and light years ahead of the rest. My biggest issue is being able to multitask and having fast processor speed. The DNA doers this very well. I can go in and out of functions while texting and/or opening apps and is does not slow down or seize up like my razor. The quad core is the way to go. Screen is very nice, phone thin, light. Beats audio is great for working out. Battery life only drains to @50% at end of day with my GPS off. Drains to about 20% with GPS on all day. And that is with heavy usage as I work medical and am looking up info and texting orders to nurses all day. p
I ordered this phone simply hoping that it would work. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was in near-perfect condition with no scratches or anythinig. It works fine with no problems. Very happy with purchase. p
good no scratches and not a hard droid to work with i wish it came with book so i can know more p
great phone, wished i could have afforded the htc one but this is the next best thing just about the same with some differences over all its great, and by the way it is unlocked but if you have verizon and you update the firmware verizon will lock it, found that out the hard way but you can always unlock it again if you know what your doing. only draw back its the battery life, if you use it with the screen on like games or movies the 1080p use a lot of power even if your just looking at pics, with that said if you are playing music and turn the screen off youll save a lot of juice. i be leave the htc one solve that problem, i suggest getting a battery pack if you are going to get this phone that is if you travel some place where you cant charge your phone . over all good perches p
The large HD screen is bright and beautiful, its fast and able to be used on multiple networks. Only small complaint is the battery life is not that great but considering the power of the phone I would say it does very well. p
I am an Android phone convert into Windows phone and back to Android once again. This phone is super fast and is compatible with prepaid GSM carriers such as ATT and T-Mobile. I am personally using T-Mobiles' Monthly 4G plan and it is working out great so far. The design is beautiful and the phone doesn't weigh much more that the GS3 but is slightly taller on height but the width is just about the same. The display though! It is the best you will get until 1080P displays start becoming the new trend. p
Returned n
It's OK p
Bought as a gift. She loved it! p
It didn't come with a charger and the chargers I have won't work. Also the phone does not work properly n
the phone is not unlocked for verizon use, its locked with us cellular, I could not use it on my Verizon account n
The ac adapter stopped working. n
loved it! p
the phone was good but it was not compatible to what I wanted it. it's a CDMA and i wanted a GSM. The seller was nice that I can return the phone and was understanding. Other than that, if you want it to work CDMA and it doesn't have a sim card slot the phone will be good for you. Thank you again for good service. p
Seller was fantastic to go through. Phone came quickly and in great condition as described. Would happily buy from the seller again. The phone is 3G and a bit slower in apps and browser than most 3G phones. It worked great for music texting and calls. I used it as an in between while waiting on my new phone. n
Was not what expected n
This phone is really horrible. It is near impossible to text on and the calls are ALWAYS dropped! The camera is garbage and the internet functions are limited, this is clearly an outdated phone. I got it as a short term replacement for a broken smart phone and I regret it! n
I can hear the person talking . But they can't hear me talk. also it freezes at all times... I hate it. waist of money. n
Its okay but it still has a few issues like other phones. screen freezes, freezes somestimes when surfing the internet. n
After two months the phone stopped charging which is after the return policy expired. the phone could not download some of the popular apps instagram, kick and snapchat. should have gone with an iPhone. n
I don't like this phone at all. It doesn't do what I want it to do. I've had to restart it quite a few times since I bought it in the last few months due to the phone's constant freeze of the screen. It doesn't dial when I dial on the keypad. It wouldn't catch wifi unless it gets restarted first. I wouldn't have bought this if I'd known it'd give me so much trouble. n
This phone was said to be in great working condition. It was far from it. The battery lasted for 2 hours if you were lucky, and could take up to 30 minutes to send one text message. I quickly went back to my old school flip phone because it works 100x faster than this supposing "smart phone". n
Brought this phone for my dad and he hated it. I even played with it for a day and it sucked. It calls people by itself and text people also. DO NOT BUY. n
Almost no battery life with little or no use in the day, no sd card was installed, it has a cheap feel in its construction, and its nearly impossible to hear a call coming in no matter how high the volume or choice of ring tone if the phone is in my pocket or lying on its back on a couch arm. This was NO bargain. n
HTCWell marked icons in the phone.Very neat camera.For person special needs it's very useful very excellent constast.I really love it.Heidi Burns Rourke p
the phone is great, and with the wifi, i don't have to pay for data charges. I just connect to a hot spot...AWESOME p
Looks greats ...works OK n
HTC is a great manufacturer with outstanding widgets but the device has charging issues therefore I am returning. n
the equipment was damaged in 1 week n
This phone was used and they gave me a phone that did not work and they gave me the wrong charger ! Horrible and a waste of money !! n
This product was as advertised. n
Locked, could not use. n
the phone did not work and the seller is not responding about replacing the item or refunding my money n
Eh n
Phone mother board went dead. Lost all my photos all my contacts all my APPs. How horrible. What a waste of a lot of money. n
I should of just bought a new phone the description said 90 some% good but it was more like. 90% bad, after having it flashed we had it activated for my daughter, and since she's had it she's. Only been able to make a couple calls on it because no one can hear each other and she can't send any text to my phone because they all fail, if she sends a picture message, you can expect it days later this was a very bad choice and a waste of money now I have to get her a phone that actually works. n
Nioce p
verry good p
No i thought it was going to be bigger n
old phone for this technology (2015)...but still a cool phone. reminds me of the blackberry. p
GREAT SERVICE, GREAT PRODUCT!! p
This is a replacement for the exact same phone which had broken. It works great. Shipment was fast. Excellent experience. p
Honestly, it's just really slow and unresponsive. n
I am very displeased. This order came without many listed items such as the phones battery, charger and the back piece (battery cover). n
Bought 2 of these for 59.00 one works fine and the other is slow and freezes often. They did not come with SD cards, nor instructions. They aren't worth 59.00, should have been less money. n
Love this phone. p
Less than a year of minor use and there are dead spots on the touch screen. It never really worked well to begin with.It appears that all phones being sold on Amazon these days are refurbished or factory rejects. n
This phone doesn't have a place for a chip and where am from I can't even use it. Waste of my time and money n
This phone does what I needed it to do- call and text. Don't even try to get on Facebook with this phone. It's way too slow. Also, "onemobile" advertises this as a new phone. Obviously it isn't. Dust where the battery should be and scratches on the back of the phone. It's not a huge deal but should be correctly advertised. All in all, you get what you pay for. n
the phone and other pieces went to my daughter back in the states she enjoyed it and i enjoyed the price p
Phone is junk, had it over a year and have just given up using the browser. Text and calls are all it is good for. n
I'm impressed. It's easy to use, very intuitive. My only problem is the battery life isn't as long as I would like. It's fine if you don't use the games or other programs much. All in all, a great value. p
still learning everything on it but i do like the phone . looking forward to using it more and learning all the other features it has p
The phone is awesome for a cheapie. It can be rooted and there are clockwork mods for this phone that work great. the stock rom was running too slowly but with froyo it works great and updated to 2.2 with the mod of course. 4 start because the sync cable has never kept a connection with my pc and is pretty much unusable now. p
I bought this phone because it was less expensive than fully replacing my shattered Motorola. But I've had it only a few weeks, and the charger has lost one of its prongs. I've never seen a charger lose a prong before! Since it's an odd charger, I can't just use one of the others I have around the house. A Garmin charger will fit, but I'd have to be driving to use that. n
I really Love my HTC it's very cool and easy to uses thanks again for the opportunity to experience this tech device. p
This is a really good phone. Sometimes the battery gets low pretty quick,but that's the price you pay when you surf the web, listen to music and etc. Overall, I think that this is a good phone for the price. p
I really thought this was gonna be a good first smart phone but its not at all its very complicated to use and the directions do not help at all over all its fast enternet speed was the best part but other then that there was nothing else good or easy to do on this phone at not only that you cant use backup assitant on this device so inless ur syncing your contacts with facebook,microscoft,or googel accounts then your entering all of them by hand witch takes forever not a good first smart phone at all :( n
First of all, I am very sad, that the Mobile I buy, it was not according to my requirement.This mobile doesn't works in Pakistan, as it was without Sim.And the seller didn't mentioned there.So it was just useless for me. There must be proper and complete information for every product. n
My item came as fast as usual and was delivered in perfect shape. Good phone, very good phone...but, this old lady is having a hard time getting to know all the features. I'm getting there and thank goodness I have adult kids that can lead me! p
the shipping was prompt and on time as expected. the phone is very glitchy, its probably a refurb. The screens pull to the left most screen all the time, load times vary and are often very long, and it freezes all the time. n
There are many, and I mean MANY, negative reviews out about this phone. However, you have to know what you're buying. Does this droid run like the new iphone? No. However, is it a reasonably priced decent smart phone? Absolutely! Here are some of the reasons I love it:1. Easy to Use and customize From the first moment I turned it on, I went through a sort of "tutorial" that allowed me to become familiar with the phone and calibrate it for my touch :). Also the very first day I started customizing it, with the easy of access Market widget programmed into the phone you can easily download apps to customize the look of your phone.2. Decent Battery Time Does the battery last forever? No, but in this day and age what does? Realistically this battery is amazing, I use my phone as a mp3 player- which it has great sound quality and easy to use music functions like shuffle and repeat and create playlists and other good stuff- and I like to play solitare whilst listening to my music and I'll do this for hours before my battery even thinks about moving. After like 3 hours of that plus another 2 hours of messaging and talk time with background sync and apps running (which you don't have to have your setting work like this but I prefer it to just so I can stay current with all of my updates) the battery will be a little low. However if its just on and I'm no really doing anything then it will last like a little over a day without neeeding to be charged.ConsSometimes it can run a little slow especially when I have messages coming in at once and I'm listening to music at the same time.The phone gets hot- like burn your face if you're talking for more than an hour hot- as for why it does this I'm not sure... However, I find if I pull it away for about 30 seconds it cools down, maybe its just my face? Maybe it because I'm hot ;)... Other than that enjoy the phone especially because mine was brand spanking new for only 40 bux :D p
Hey Everyone, Iam very happy so far with the H.T.C. Eris cell I brought on amazon about a month ago,so far so good ,the phone is a older one but it works great !!!! p
Got this phone almost a year ago and only a month till I can upgrade. Started off okay, then started having screen problems, would always scroll to the left. Started affecting my ability to text, would freeze it all the way. Phone restarts whenever it wants to. Sometimes won't even let me text at all. Won't let me delete them either. I've had about four factory resets . POS phone. n
It took me the full 30 days to return this phone. I thought it was operator-error (or that I was going crazy), but when I went to Verizon to talk about getting another phone they told me I was the 3rd person that day to walk in with an Eris saying it was the "worst phone EVER." I like a Droid, but this thing took forever to power up, would be fully-charged one moment, and need a charge the next. The screen would "short out" while I was using it, and the swiping was erratic. I don't know how it can be so wildly different from the Droid Incredible--which I liked. n
My son loves this phone. He uses it for an MP3 player and its his own piece of heaven. Good deal p
TT-Guys are great. You solve my problem on time and reply me as soon as possible. I will recommand to every one. you done a great job ! p
This phone is listed in the "Unlocked" category, but that's not true. There's no simple way of unlocking a phone that doesn't have a SIM card, and this one definitely doesn't, no matter how you look at it. The manual that comes with the phone tells the user that the phone has an easily accessible sliding door for the card, but that door is nowhere to be found. Stay away from this product - fraud. n
I love to have unlocked phone so that i can used it international but what i get was not like that. n
When the item arrived I was so excited to have a phone again! But I put the battery in and plugged it up and NOTHING happened it Doesn't work AT ALL! Now I am Still without a phone Thanks to Ross Cellular! I am returning it and Not ordering any Electronic device from a third party seller Ever Again! n
I know it was a used product but the seller never told me that the Volume button was removed from device ....Anyway After I tested the Phone it worked very fine and the problem with the Volume Button... solved with an Android App that sets all sounds from touch screen. n
this phone was a good price, but it freezes up, the battery have to be charged to often, not what i expected. i need another phone already :( n
Fast shipping, quick responses to questions and an excellent phone no problems at all. I love the phone it is in excellent condition. I was absolutely pleased and will order again from them. p
i love this phone. it has alot of good qualities to it. the seller is awesome to my screen shatered and he is giving me another one. the phone is not to big not to small just right its does not really have any problems as far as i can tell i would recomend this phone for anyone easy to use and such a great phone. p
I got this phone this morning.. as a replacement for my old phone. And it works okay very slow at times.. The little moving ball only woks when you move it to the right, up, down, but NOT left. When your making a call and you put your face up to the screen it goes black then when your done making the call or you need to use the dial-pad it doesn't always show up so you cant access that menu, or hang up the call.. Got it refurbished and EVERY other Refurbished phone I have gotten is like new! this is a let down. n
They send the wrong charger, now instead of a phone I have an erand to run to get one that fits. n
Runs slow but enjoying at the moment n
Battery doesn't hold charge very long. Screen is already freezing n
wrong pin load n
good phone a little quirky at times p
thank you for the item p
Item as described but i hate the phone p
Trash n
Bad phone. Had to return. n
Phone works good but had more wear to it cosmetically than expected. p
Great phone p
I'm very happy with the purchase of this item,,, also had the best price and the p
Doesn't work. Gets stuck in re-boot loops for tens of minutes. Randomly turns off and restarts. 3g DOESN'T WORK. The second I turn on 3g it turns off every single time and then gets stuck in a reboot mode. Phone freezes, glitches, and lags. Not sure what the people did from the store but this was by far the worst phone I've had. I went back to my old Incredible with a broken screen just so I could have a phone that does basic...smart phone stuff.Terrible. Returning. Buy the Motorola Moto G (first gen) instead, beautiful phone for cheap. n
phone works great p
Poor quality, could not be activated with pageplus, SIM card not working with even it has SIM card holder and gsm band. n
I had the phone for 2 weeks and the phone stopped charging.. Never will I ever purchase from this company again!! n
came apart after 90 days n
Terrible sale, LCD on screen went out 2 days after I got it in the mail. n
When the phone came, it looked good, but when I started to use it, all I got was a black screen, it would shut off when I was trying to work it, and I could not tell when a text came in or who was calling. n
Exactly as described. p
Great little phone p
I had this item like 2months and the battery port fried not very happy wouldn't let me return or even refund my money n
Taking time to learn to use my phone that is smarter than I am. I discover new ways to use it every day! p
Phone was fine just wasn't what I wanted after I saw it screen was not big enough it was a grest phone p
Price was right.All the possible features I thought necessary were included.Fully unlocked so works well with any carrier. p
Good phonetakes great pictures. Easy to useHad to download different ringtones and an app to keep alerting me when I have a text message p
I cannot say how much I LOVE this phone, it is fast,and with the mini sd card,has a big capacity for any app I want...LOVE this phone- great seller, great price! I debated between this,and the Motorola Droid3....(I wanted a 3g phone) The droid is ok, but this Phone has a WAY better camera,and much better processing speed than Droid3. p
everything i need nothing i dont good quality not the newest model for for age it is up to date for needs p
Phone was exactly as described. Came with 16 gig micro SD. Very easy to set up and use. would recommend to anyone who needs a replacement or a backup phone. p
I had the Droid Incredible 2 4G LTE, but it decided to take a swim and the screen stopped working. Needed a cheap replacement so picked this... Actually, I didn't realize it was different than the one I had until it came, I was rushing and didn't read the description carefully. At any rate, I actually think I like it a little better than the newer 4G LTE version. I don't even really notice the difference from 4G to 3G with this phone. Also, I really like that even when I don't have 3G service, I can still make calls. For some reason with the 4G version, if one thing went down the phone didn't work at all. I might even keep it a bit past my contract renewal date (July). p
Awesome 1st smart phone. I did my home work and it paid off big time. I love my Droid phone. p
The phone was exactly like the description. It works perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase . Thank you p
We got the phone faster than they anticipated. I is in near perfect condition, better than they described. It works great except the battery was shot - not unexpected for a phone this old. VERY HAPPY!! p
My daughter had an I Phone that was stolen and we needed to find her a phone. She was not a big fan of her I Phone and chose to try this one out. She absolutely loves it and it has everything she needs. Great phone. Wish I would have gotten it when I upgraded last summer!!! p
I'm an Android person and love the HTC Droid Incredible 2. This is my 3rd Incredible 2 and I will hate to have to change phones when it is not longer available! p
good p
2nd time around and I love this phone! The first phone messed up after 3 days but the second one hasn't messed up at all, bluetekusa were very considerate and made sure I was satisfied! p
Great phone! p
This was sold as a supposedly new phone but I doubt it. The packaging was tampered with and some of the accessories like the charger were not stock. Also, the lower part of the screen doesn't work well and everyone complains that the microphone doesn't work well - hard to hear what I am saying. So, I am pretty sure this is a refurbished handset.When I complained to the seller they offered to replace it for free and begged not to leave bad feedback. But I decided I couldn't be without a phone for a week while I waited for another one to arrive so I am just living with this partially functional phone until I get fed up and buy a new one. n
We bought this phone new. Had it about 5 months and it wont charge a battery. Tried different outlets and chargers and it will not charge. n
Very nice phone. Works well. It is very fast and it has an excellent camera. I have no complaints at all. p
Great phone. Practically brand new. Works like new. Great seller and great transaction. p
Perfect p
Excellent p
Phone kept draining batteries. Not worth the money or effort. n
Very nice phone, a little smaller than expected but otherwise functions perfectly and maintains a good charge. I enjoyed getting my items in one package. The packaged was wrapped and packed perfectly with great protection. I really appreciate the time and care you put in packing my orders perfectly. Thank you p
The HTC phone works great, we chose it for the battery life and it's hand size, only wish I would have known it didn't come with SIM card needed to activate p
All good except for one warning to potential buyers of the Incredible 2. It is so old, here in 2016, that Google Play Store cannot download for-pay applications. Free apps are good; for-pay, no-way. p
This phone has been nothing but trouble. I had to replace the battery twice within like 3 months, I finally gave up and spent MORE money on a different phone-- not worth it. n
The phone doesn't work properly unless the back is off it no good n
Phone is okay. Doesn't charge without taking the battery out n
phones speaker barely worked,couldnt recieve txts.just a mess!so dissapointed!!!on and port to charge is bad also!!!!!!only took a charge 40 percent of time! n
So many problems with that phone! I am giving up on htc.. second phone like this one that will simply not charge... charge light comes on but not really charging, have tried different chargers, batteries and still nothing :-( n
The cellphone stop working the first week. I talk about refund, but never send the cellphone back because im in Venezuela and its complicated and expensive. No one here could repair the phone, its dead. n
Love the HTC Droid Incredible 2, This is my first Smart Phone and I love it. Battery seems to draw down Fast, Then I learned how to turn off some of the apps when not in use, and that has made battery life longer. Wonder if there is a EXTENDED Life Battery available for this Phone? p
I Love this phone! So far so good! I Haven't had any problems with it. Would recommend to everyone. thanks p
This is a very good phone, I ordered it for my son and he loves it. He can download all the apps and ringtones he likes. good quality and price. p
Is awesome I like it alot is a really good phone and it's not too big and it's convenient for me p
Phone screen doesn't always work, screen sometime just shuts off and phone restarts. Sometime when o click a contact to call it calls a completely different one.Love these phones this one is faulty however. n
It sucks it will not charge. When it does charge it only last for maybe an hour. Don't waste your money. n
SD card doesn't work holds no memory doesn't even allow sim card to work very dissatisfied. Not what I expected n
Great cell phone but had to return it because it was not unlock. If I could find the same model again in a unlock cell I would purchase again. n
I was expecting 4G and it was tiny as hell. Not at all what i thought was coming in the mail. n
The phone has worked well- have no complaints. It charges easily and holds a charge. Would purchase another one if needed another. p
Very happy with out new HTC Droid Incredible 2. Bought it for my wife who is new to smart technology, but she loves it. Received it on time and in good condition. Very happy with the results. p
they stole my phone has a broken screen and then informed me that I had paid. I want my money back. thanks n
They were supposed to be unlocked, they were not unlocked. It was a horrible headache trying to get them unlocked. n
love it just like my old one. Clean face and back. Would buy again if I need it. Told my friends and family p
After 6 months of using the phone, it would not charge. I took it to Verizon. They brought to my attention that this phone was not purchased new. The after market paint gave it away. Do not buy a phone from this seller. They are illegally selling used phones as new. n
Love this phone ,but for some reason it came without the camera chip inside.I had to use the one from my old phone in left to take pictures.Not understand why such a great phone would not have the picture chip with phone. n
SO I bought this phone over 6 months ago and still is amazing. Unfortunately got caught up in the hype of IPhone and got an iphone. Omg how I have learned that I can not stand the iphone. Will go back to my droid.This is truly a great phone! It is a great investment and a very sturdy phone as I am a Mom of five kids and this phone is still flawless after bumps drops drool and the whole nine yards! p
i ordered this phone because i love htc phones....pulled it out of the box and it looked flawless!!! powered it up and all seemed well but i quickly noticed i couldnt bring the notification bar down!! within days the digitizer failed and the phone was useless....not to mention the charging/data port was faulty also...it charged but thats it couldnt get it to connect to my computer...so all in all i suppose maybe i just got a bad phone but i for one will not be buying from this company again! n
I replaced my old HTC Incredible with newer version, loved my old phone. Only thing I would change is size, liked size of old one. p
Awesome phone, works great on Page Plus Cellular, along with saving a ton of money compared to Verizon, I also have a great phone. Verizon phone on Verizon network for half the price www.pageplusca.com is the Page Plus dealer to use, great customer support. Update I've had this phone for 6 months now, still works great, if your expecting a top of the line Verizon phone, this isn't it, this is however, probably the best 3g phone available to use on the Page Plus / Verizon network, only 3g. Phone is still fast and responsive, great android phone. p
The phone works by 10/4Battery and the camera does not work well in addition to the presence of scratches on the screen n
I bought this phone to replace one just like it. Both phones have had problems with the start button on the top right sticking. On the first phone, I just assumed it was a fluke, but it looks like it could be a common problem among this brand. When the button sticks, it is nearly impossible to unstick it and therefore, it is unable to be turned on/off or for the screen to be accessible once the back light turns off. To fix it, I would have to remove the battery, restart and turn the back light on at all times, which drained the battery within a few hours.Other than that, it is a great phone. n
This cell phone was expensive. It broke after 7 months of gentle use. The warranty is only for 90 days, so now I have to purchase another cell phone. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item. n
Great phone , works just like its supposed to and looks new thank you would recommend to all . I wish it came with earphones and an sd card p
i got a good phone that was in mint condition as probmised and had no problem switching from my broken adroied phone to this one. also had no problem with esn or keeping my old number and did it all myself using information from youtube and kittywireless.com p
For the first couple months the phone worked great. It came in the condition advertised and in a very timely manner. However, we've been using it a little over 2 months and have issues with it charging for the 5 weeks; it is getting to the point you have to sit and hold the charger in the slot or the phone won't charge. Did not have this issue with the previous phone, same model. p
Had to order the product twice. The first time I ordered, part of the touch screen did not work. The dealer was really great about exchanging it and reimbursing me for the shipping costs. I received my replacement item just a few days later. The phone looked great and operated great for about a month. Just after my 30-day warrantee (offered by the dealer), the phone would not hold a charge. I replaced the battery twice and it still would not hold a charge. I eventually took it to a Verizon store and they diagnosed the problem with a broken charging port. Unfortunately it isn't worth replacing the charging port.All that being said, the product worked for about a month. Now it is a piece of technology that will not turn on... n
Excellent p
Works as intended. No problems. p
Good p
The cellphone is frized not come unlocked n
Perfect p
I purchased this phone primarily bc the seller said the software was upgradeable to a 4. 0 Ice Cream Sandwich...however the phone itself can not support such an upgrade. With the software as it is now I can not watch movies and most apps are not supported I'm highly dissapointed by this product n
good price for a simple smart phone p
It is ok, it does what I need it to do and that's the main thing n
Always satisfied p
does not come with a sim card and listed as new i would like a sim card to be delivered or i will return the phone. n
bueno n
If you are reading this review, it is 2015 or later. This is not a new phone. You are looking to buy this phone because it is really cheap for what you are getting - a working Android device with a decent camera and no obvious design flaws. It is certainly that. Apples to apples, used, this beats an iPhone 4 any day - and those are running for %50 more than these. (I picked this up for $65 while an iPhone 4 in similar condition was $115.)But, for the love of god, if you are even the slightest bit technologically literate - root your phone and install a new ROM. A lot of these Amazon reviews are complaining about the software, how there are a bunch of bundled Verizon apps (NFL??) that you can't uninstall and that are constantly running - yeah, it's really annoying. Also, the HTC Sense UI is waaay outdated. It was already sketchy in 2012, now it looks like absolute garbage. But guess what? You aren't stuck with it. You don't need to worry about rooting voiding your warranty because that expired 2 years ago. I have Cyanogenmod installed and life is 100% better than the stock ROM. No bloatware, just simplicity and full customization. On the stock ROM, I had to charge the battery every night just from daily use (texting and the occasional website - nothing heavy). Now I last 3-4 days on a single charge.A couple negative notes. The product description claims "16GB SD card preinstalled". Don't expect this if you buy used. The sellers don't mention this in the product description but expect to drop an extra $15 on a new SD card to get this phone functional (you can't do much without one, no pictures or anything). Also, Verizon requires a data plan on all smartphones - I bought this phone expecting to be able to use my existing dumb-phone plan with it, but that is just not how things work apparently - had to upgrade to a data plan to activate the phone! I am not happy about that.Still, highly recommended. This is still a quality device even three years after release. p
Quit working not long after purchase n
Phone was defective from the start n
Had this phone for about a month. The charging port broke and had to get a new phone already. Not worth the money. n
Screen blacked out and would not come on after a week of use. n
Very good p
good p
Great phone! I bought this as a replacement. I've had a HTC Droid incredible 2 for a while and love it! When I couldn't get old one to charge with any charger or battery, I knew I needed new phone and decided to buy same one cuz of how great this phone is :D p
It wasnt clear in the ad this is not 4G. n
I am having problems with the phone I purchased. The phone looks in good condition but the touch screen does not work properly. I am trying to send back or exchange n
I enjoy this phone. It is a substitute for my damaged samsung galaxy sIII.It is a great phone. Feels better in the hand than the large sized samsung galaxy. p
The phone arrived in good looking condition, but it would not stay connected to the network. Tried master reset, took it into multiple stores to have it trouble shot, but would not work. Complete waste. n
The phone is more than enough of what I need in a phone. The only downside is that, because it's used, it came with a damaged audio imput and I have to adjust my earphone jack once in a while to get sound. p
Keypad only works sometimes and apparently I can't replace it, only return it.Which means I would have no phone at all. I thought everything on Amaxon was guarnteed. Guess not. n
Simply said "new" Came in original box, manufacture security sealed. All contents were manufacture security sealed.Great price. Works great with Kitty Wireless (page plus). Its only Day 2, my expectations are high. Shipped fast. Returned one from NUTWO that stated "NEW" receipt said "NEW". Wouldn't charge, and was refurbished (void sticker over a screw was missing and a inspection sticker was in place). p
I bought this Android phone because my original phone (iPhone) was stolen. This works fine as a backup; I would not choose Android phones or this particular phone again. OS is very slow, updates via Google Play are not intuitive enough to get through, and many phone apps are not all compatible either with this phone or on Android platform. n
First the phone came without a battery, so we had to order one. Once we put the battery in and charged the phone we realized the power button didn't work!!!!! Only good thing about this order was how easy Amazon made it for me to return it!!!! n
The phone itself has great features, but it stopped charging! I'm very disappointed! I don't know why it just stopped working n
This is a great phone. Very easy to use and it arrived just as I thought. Very pleased with my purchase. p
This is 4G, I thought it was a 3G. I talked to Page Plus after it arrived and they told me it wouldnt work, so I returned it. I found a 6300 on Ebay that does work. n
Received promptly, happy with this choice. Thank you. p
Arrived on time & item was as described. Works great. p
Loved the idea of the phone, was very upset when the phone was picky about the charger I used and would not charge on any of my two car chargers. Also it only downloaded some pictures I would recieve via text. Other than that great pictures and fun to play with, just wish it would have worked fully. n
Nice product, arrived on time , would recommend! p
Works well with PagePlus phone service. Many features and good reception and transmission. Excellant camera. p
Excelente p
This is exactly what I expected. Replacement phone for my son. I would order another! p
Very happy with this purchase. If anyone needs a phone I recommend this website. Great product p
Phone was 5 star battery was at best a 2..would never charge all the way up, had to replace it right away. n
I absolutely love this phone. I bought it used and it was in mint condition. There are tons of cases available on Amazon for it. I liked the phone so much, I bought several. I've always been a Blackberry girl but I think I'm an HTC girl now. It has a built in processor so it doesn't have the lag my Motorola or LG Droid had. p
replacement for phone so i could really have chosen another brand and type but went with the HTC Incredibel 2. p
No I don't like it. It keeps shutting down by itself. I want to know how can I get a replacement n
Great phone, I'd had it when I worked for big red and loved it. I now use straight talk which gives me the freedom to use any device regardless of carrier and use that carrier's network and I had no problem using this phone on straight talk. There was a down side however...the radio in this device was malfunctioning and could not hold a signal, unfortunately the vendor did not have anymore available to I had to hop over to wally world and buy a Galaxy SII and pop in an AT&T sim. p
I bought the phone new,but It came to me used. The phone was dropped on the side causing a small dent. The packaging was opened and all the stuff that was suppose to come with it was not included; items like the user guide etc, were not shipped with the phone. n
When it arrived it worked perfectly but after a month or so it began to freeze up on me and after about 4 months, it completely shutdown. It would only show a white screen. Don't waste your time. n
The phone was purchase in May and it is not holding a charge. Not sure what is causing it. Very big pain n
Horrible!!!! charging port on phone came out and replacement phone would not charge and volume didn't work. The HTC incredible 2 was the sorriest piece of junk I ever bought. Very unhappy and dissatisfied with my purchase. DON'T DESERVE A STAR!!!! n
This is a great little phones with no issues that have come to light since I have had it. I have had it about 2 monthes now and it works great. Works with my PagePlus Service. p
I aleady own an HTC Incredible 2 and knew they are great phones. My wife had a Droid 4 and the battery was so bad that she had to keep charging it multiple times per day. Unfortunately she's not due for an upgrade for another eight months (thanks Verizon). I purchased this phone hoping that it would be in good enough condition to get her through the next eight months. The phone was in great condition and it works fine, just as it was advertised. My wife and I are both very happy with this phone and would certainly purchase from this seller again. p
So far so good no complains p
Didn't work from the beginning. n
Very happy with my purchase..:-) p
Just a bad phone went through 2 of the same one battery problems don't buy n
bought as a gift ... worked about 2 months. n
looks great and love the design p
Just returned the 2nd one. 1st one went dead after I activated it, it wouldn't turn on. The 2nd one worked for 3 days then went dead. No time for this. n
good phone better than lg p
For the price it is about what I expected. A real negative is the sound quality when I receive calls. Not clear at all. Sounds like it's coming thru a cracked speaker. Other than that it seems to do what I need it to. n
Worked perfect..fast shipping p
The screen itself arrived slightly popped out, and dust and dirt have been collecting underneath the screen. Impossible to clean out, and not something you can just fix. n
it worked great and but the front was very scratched up around the sides there were no scratches on the screen though and that's a plus! n
I had this phone less than a month and the screen stopped working in certain places. I know can only speak my text messages and can't make phone calls. n
the first week it started charging ok but after I had to twist it in order to charge and sometimes it doesn't even charge n
The HTC Droid has been all we expected. Has not shut down unexpectedly or frozen. All features have worked well. p
This phone is the worst phone ever with signal I changed over to this phone from a LG Alley Bad mistake! I wasted $ 149.00 on this phone and cannot return it! I will be going back to my Alley. Don't buy this phone unless you wan't one with bad signal strength. if you are looking for a good cheap smart phone. I would highly suggest getting the LG Alley. n
Needed a replacement phone as I can't get phone insurance due to too many claims! This was the same type of phone that I had damaged and it came in good condition and quickly. The phone was able to have service put in my name and there were no problems at all with doing so. The cost was the same as if I had made and insurance claim and had to pay a deductible. p
A Gift for a Grand daughter, who has a requirement for a phone every 90 days, This phone was purchase at a good price, I wouldrecommend all purchase thru Amazon. p
I bought this phone to replace my Droid X2. I loved that phone alot. But after about 18 months of use, that phone had finally died off. I will start off by saying when doing this review, you do have to take in consideration that this phone has been out over 2 years now, so it will have some disadvantages.That being said there are both really good and bad aspects of this phone.One of my favorite features is the speaker phone mode; while on a phone call if set the phone face down, it will automatically switch to speaker phone. This comes in handy while driving and i use this everyday.Another feature i enjoy is the menus option. There are four options to choose from when displaying apps. "All Apps, Frequent, Downloaded & Verizon" I keep my phone set on the "Frequent" setting. It will display your 16 most used apps.The call quality on this phone is actually decent to good. In comparsion to my driod x2 people can hear me alot better. And i tend to be able to hear better.The HTC Sense User Interface is great too. I love the little weather widget. Whatever the weather is the phone screen will actually display that. Meaning when its raining the phone shows rain and wiper blades wipe it away. Really cool Feature.While the phone has some good aspects, there are also some not so great factors.The battery life, like most smart phones, isnt that great. But in comparison to my droid x2, this battery life really blows. If you barely use your phone, you will not notice a problem. Moe than about 3 hours a day, and youll be running low. The charge time also takes atleast 4 hours for me.Another problem, i encounter is that phone will freeze up more and moore with time. Which isnt that uncommon, but like others have stated, the reboot time can be about five minutes and will use atleast 15% or more of your battery life.The actual phone itself, i have noticed, isnt very durable. The first few times it dropped or fell, even just a little bit of distance then phone became deeply scratched and dented. Not exactly sure what its made from, but quality isnt a strong feature. I bought a snap on case for this phone and its helped abit.For the starter to average user, this phone will do the job. Just dont expect wonders to be made while using it. Good sound quality, Great user interface and Verizon wireless coverage make this phone worth while._________________________________________________________________its now 6months later. my phone is now dead. doesnt ring, wifi doesnt work, dead pixels and digitizer wiped. there are Better phones for the money. n
This is my second HTC Incredible 2. I loved the phone and its size, layout etc. But after about 1 year the charging port glitch started. Just as the other reviews mentioned. Won't charge while on the charger (tried several kinds) Then finally stopped charging all together.LIKE A DUMMY!!!! I thought I just got a bad phone and I ordered another HTC In2 on Amazon. After about 3 months, it is sitting beside me refusing to charge. I am on here to buy a Droid X2.Save yourself the heartache and cash!!! n
Very happy with this product. Fast processor. Seriously like having a tablet in your pocket. p
Didn't come with a manual supposedly brand new......,,,... n
This phone has got to be one of the worst investments in my life. If this phone was human it would've died when I first purchased it n
Within a couple weeks of getting this phone, the charger broke down, no big deal, I have a few more laying around that worked well enough. It was a slow loading phone, but one that I got to bridge the gap between my last phone breaking down and when I could get a new one for free with my free upgrade. The battery drained rapidly. I would charge it until my work shift began, and it would be on its last legs by lunch break, that's 4 hours. Four hours of battery life with 15 minutes of usage in that period of time. And then the battery stopped charging. And now it's a brick. n
After 3 weeks phone went black. n
It's okay but very small. Also it a 3G even though I thought that it was supposed to be a 4G n
Not what I expected. n
I got this phone for my 8yr olds birthday. It is exactly what I needed. He was happy with it and that is all that mattered. The phone was also easy to activate through Verizon. p
great p
great p
I love my phone its not to big & not to small & takes lovely pics. p
Had better phones needs to be new to much on phone already. n
this phone does everything you need p
So disappointed! Bought this phone and less then two months later it wouldn't do anything. The screen went black and won't charge. Biggest waist of money!! n
The original phone had a much bigger screen. I could of bought a much better phone for the same price. n
This phone was broken when I received it. n
i order this phone and the port didn't work for it. i know this because my brother had this same phone so i tried his charger the charger that came with it and another charger nothing worked.... meaning it didn't charge it. I also switched the batteries... didn't work i had to return it and ordered a new one... for a different site..thanks for the peice of crap phone! n
:) n
bought this for a friend as he needed a phone and he liked the features and the price. n
Thanks, Great! Good Seller! p
This phone has so much power but is underutilized. Verizon has not put out a software update for this phone for years, so it's still using Android 2.2 and will probably never get an upgrade. The battery life is atrocious. it will last for 2 hours on standby before needing a charge. n
Had phone for about one week and it stopped charging it canâ€™t even tell the charger is connected. Do not buy this phone waist of money. n
Item works great. Arrived in a timely fahison as well. SD card randomly says it was removed. But its a 3 year old phone. p
The charging port stopped working two weeks after I got the phone phone. Other than that its a good phobw n
Ordered one of these, and the next day the phone started shutting itself off and on every 30 secs. returned it and got a replacement which worked fine for maybe a week, then also started shutting off and also will not connect to ANY wifi. n
I bought this to replace my existing HTC DI2. It is not quite the same as the one I had before. The back is larger and therefore cannot fit into a protective case, and the product was very dirty when I got it. n
I purchased this phone and the first 2 days it broke and I ordered a replacement and then within 3 months that one stopped charging and the screen quit responding so it was a total waste of money. I will never buy this phone again. I Ignored the ratings by people saying "nah its not that bad" but yeah it really was.. Do not buy! n
Got this to active with page plus for my husband; since I have the incredible and enjoy it. Well the battery wouldn't last him for 3 hours even if he wasn't using it. Now I know most smart phone batteries aren't great but this was obscene! I checked the processes running and there were 15 going at all times; even with Wi-Fi turned off it was dead by his first break at work. Maybe we just got a bad one...I doubt it though. n
Came with everything, battery, sim card, person I bought it from didn't reset the phone! But I did as soon as I received it in great shape. Fast shipping! p
I received the phone and it was broken. It would not charge and the people that sent it to me would not do anything to help. Waste of money. Never buying from this group again!!! n
I bought this phone brand new. Everything worked fine except the mic. Having a phone that you can't make calls with is like having a watch that doesn't tell time. I returned for a refurbished one, and the charge port on that one was broken. They were from two different sellers. Here's hoping the third time's a charm... n
The new phone arrived within the 2-day promised time but we cannot get the wireless setting to hold, it keeps loosing connection at home where we have a great signal and any other place. We've been talking to Verizon twice now, about 2 hours worth of trouble shooting. Will try one more time at the Verizon store but looks like we are completely out of the money we spent and have to buy a whole new phone. n
Quality phone, but I was not happy with the seller. n
delivery was spot on --phone performed just like the old one p
A+ p
I bought this used HTC Droid Incredible 2 as a replacement for an HTC Droid Incredible. I figured for the price I could not go wrong, and I didn't. The item came as described and has worked properly. It looks brand new. The only comment I have is that USPS is called "snail mail" for a reason. I received the item on the afternoon of the last day within the delivery time frame. My orders by other delivery services are usually delivered within 3-4 business days.The only negative is not the fault of the seller, as they shipped same day, so I can't dock them. Certainly recommend. p
It has been put to the test and has worked great. I have had no complaints. It is a new phone like they said. p
Used for PagePlus. Worked out great. Phone didn't come in an original box, but parts looked new and worked like new :) p
Really like the functionality of this phone and the perfectly sized display. The battery life is very good if your not burning too many apps. p
It doesn't charge. the battery is clearly backwards, I can see why it's being sold outside of Verizon. But I was happy with the quick mail out, it arrived sooner then anticipated (and anyone without a phone, this is HUGE!) so kudos to the company on delivery. This particular kind of phone has been known to be either good or lemony. I've gone through several myself, which is why I'm purchasing extras online. I don't fault the company. I fault HTC. Luckily this is an older model so most people won't need to worry about this kind anymore. and for those that do are prob buying it because they already have it and are aware of the problems. n
So far, so good. I like using my phone. It's a great size and "feel" in my hand. It works great. p
The item arrived before estimated due date with great quality service! The phone is in excellent condition but the charger makes noises. Also, I've had some problems downloading apps but that could be because of my provider. Thanks for the painless process! p
the phone is just a very cheaply made piece of junk, on the edge of the battery cover it has nothing to sealed off dust or water so it easily get damage by either one. n
Well received the phone today and was very pleased, the only thing i dont like it the fact the water stickers there both set off on the phone and battery, I dont know if a refurb was done but everything works! Very little wear but nothing my Otterbox wont hide. Overall I would give them 4 3/4 stars. Cust service WAS GREAT but knowing about the water damage would have been nice even tho the phone works. p
I was very happy with it when I recieved it everything worked great! This seller also did a great job packaging due to me being in Afghanistan my product got to me safe and sound. p
this phone was locked by verizon due to an unpaid bill. i was unable to use it because of that. i,therefore, am out the money i paid for it. the company i bought it from in good faith was no help and rude about my problem. therefore, i would not use them in the future. n
I placed an order for the HTC Droid Incredible 2, as was advertised and pictured, Instead I receive a old Droid Incredible with a Blackberry charger. I am furious. This seems to be a scam on a large scale. n
A great phone, the only thing I can complain about is that the on-off button starts to get stuck sometimes, at the end I fixed it by downloading an app that alows me to use the volume buttons instead of the on-off button. The rest is perfect. n
The phone was nothing like describe. The outer casing was actually falling off, and although the screen was flawless, there was tons of scrapes and scratches on the back, none of which were in the description. n
Package arrived 3 days earlier which I was very happy about. Brand new works great. The only thing that I didn't consider was the fact that I'm trying to program it in 2014 and this phone itself is a few years old so it doesn't download some apps in the app store and it can be a little slow but overall its a good phone. p
After owning this for a few months here is my view: I find this phone to be simple to use, and I love it's slim sleek design. I don't care for all the added apps that come with it, and I have yet found a way to delete them. The battery life of this phone is very low, but that is because it likes to run apps in the background. I added an task killer app and use it often and that has doubled the battery life. I love the camera on this phone, and the screen on this phone is a great size, not too big. I would buy again for a first phone for a teen, and so far it's great for me too! p
Working great, quick shipping. Phone was exactly as advertised if not a little better! Thanks! p
The phones seems ok but will not activate, I have to send it back, it is not working for me. n
Phone went blank in a month n
I needed a phone fairly quickly due to the fact that my other broke. It's a fairly decent phone so far and fairly cheap which was nice. The only problem that I had was the fact that they sent the wrong charger for the phone. n
Supposed to be brand new. Wasn't. Wouldn't charge. n
the phone sucks ass. i ordered a referbvished phone and got a used one. the charging port so not work, the phone goesw on and out of roamming. i tried to resolve the matter, and just got the run around. My name is not Taylor, i am Kenneth Mc cutchin..... I wish you all would make this right, but i really have no expectations that you will. n
Loved the HTC Driod Incredible while it was working but after a couple months it would not hold a charge then finely would not charge at all. After replaceing about 3 batteries n
excellent but it was not unlocked p
I like it better than the Droid 2 I was using. Still locks up at times and makes me crazy. Have to remember this isn't a top-notch phone that multi-tasks easily. It's a little computer that can only do so much at a time. Learning to be patient!! Still, I am enjoying it. p
From day one, the headphone jack has been defective. It is so loose and so touchy I am unable to use head phones or desk speakers with the phone. If I turn the volume control on the side of the phone up to the 3/4 mark, the audio is scratchy and unusable. Also when on speaker phone, the audio is so weak it is difficult to hear people talking to me. Also, the phone freezes up when I try to use my Live365 app for androids on it. My other phones had no problem with the app. I have had the phone for about a week and am going to get another model of Droid phone. This one is junk. If everything was operating 100% I am guessing this would be a good phone. n
I love this phone. It's my first android phone, I had a Palm Pixi Plus and this blows it away! Sound quality is good for calls. I love to use the phone to listen to FM radio and podcasts. p
had a bit of a problem but they had no problem solving my solution this seller is the best I've bought from must buy from him p
I really like it so far, fast, not too big nice display. Runs smoother than my droid 3. Running on Page Plus.Signal reception is maybe one bar lower than the droid 3 but i can live with that as long as I don't get the lag.Hopefully it will get ICS soon. Very nice phone p
I haven't had any problems yet out of this phone, excepting some sort of issue with the SD card. My phone didn't come with the SIM card however which I could have sworn it was supposed to. I haven't yet seen about finding out to rectify that problem although that is one of the reasons why I bought the phone because I do travel. Sometimes, I do have a problem seeing the screen in bright sunlight and it can run its battery down fairly fast but outside of that -- this phone is one of the best I've bought and its my first smartphone. For me, since its my first smartphone, there was a bit of a learning curve and I think that I really only use about 2% of the phone's capability but I definitely use more of those smart capabilities than I did at first! I can hear my callers very well, it takes excellent pictures -- too many extra apps on it that I don't use -- and the touchscreen keyboard is very good. Its not a giant phone but just right, I could fit it comfortably in my pocket before I put the Otterbox case on it. No complaints yet about this phone! p
I like this phone. It is easy to use very lightweight and downloading apps is fool proof. The price was reasonable too. p
I got this for my uncle and he has never had an problems with it it was like brand newAnd it was fast shipping p
the phone and it had more scratches and dents than descibed. it wasnt the phone i wanted or wasn't looking for n
I purchased this phone to use with Page Plus. Works like a dream. I have had no issues and for being used. The battery is still good which i was worried about. Would buy again p
Had the phone two days and it restarted its self lost all contacts. Owned it less than a month and its not working at all will not turn on.Got the phone on time. Have bought phones from here before and everything was great. n
This product was received in "good" condition. It was received really new, but there were some noise on back lid, but I fixed. The rest point of condition is okay. The product was not unlocked in GSM standard, also in CDMA, so you need a little "effort" to unlock it or "shake" you pocket with "greens" for people who could do it for you :) The rest is fine, I know this phone is really costs for it's "all included features". I will recommend to get this phone from trusted sellers... p
I got this one when my old one died. For being refurbished it is in excellent condition. The screen had literally no scratches at all on it. I have been using it for a couple of months now and I am very happy with it. It was shipped on time and I recieved a personal garanty from the business. p
This was a great buy. A screen replacement on old phone was about $70. For another $50 got a brand new phone/battery/charger and bonus car charger. Swapping was simple with Verizon, just swap the memory card and SIM card and do the *228 programming and you have a new phone. p
This phone definitely did not disappoint. It's more faster than than the original. The outside had a little indentation but the phone as a whole looks brand new. p
NO scratches or marks whatsoever..AMAZING condition..It looks and acts brand new..FAST delivery..Now I just need to figure out how to use it..My first smartphone and it's very nice..I appreciate it!! p
The phone worked great and almost as described and the screen was in great shape. It was sold as 'used-very good' which stated that all phone functions work perfectly; almost all of them did except the camera. There was what appeared to be lint on the inside of the protective glass in front of the lens and the pictures came out very foggy. They probably test the phones to make sure everything works but they need to add taking a photo to this list. Give me a phone that takes pictures like its supposed to and I'd give 4 stars. Give me all that and not quite such deep gauges on the bezel and I'll give 5. n
This cell phone is good quality. Although it was advertised as new and clearly was used. I was expecting a new phone. But it works well. p
I'm In LOVE with my phone! Even I bought a used one, It looks and works like new! Android is great too. Much better than Rim though. p
I bought what I thought was a New HTC Droid Incredible 2. Less than a week after I received it, the phone stopped charging and has not charged properly since. Not only did they send the wrong charger for the phone, but it was a display model, not new. I do not blame the phone itself because I do believe it is an awesome phone. I blame those who sold it to me. n
I'm very happy with the purchase of this item,,, also had the best price and the p
Doesn't work. Gets stuck in re-boot loops for tens of minutes. Randomly turns off and restarts. 3g DOESN'T WORK. The second I turn on 3g it turns off every single time and then gets stuck in a reboot mode. Phone freezes, glitches, and lags. Not sure what the people did from the store but this was by far the worst phone I've had. I went back to my old Incredible with a broken screen just so I could have a phone that does basic...smart phone stuff.Terrible. Returning. Buy the Motorola Moto G (first gen) instead, beautiful phone for cheap. n
phone works great p
Poor quality, could not be activated with pageplus, SIM card not working with even it has SIM card holder and gsm band. n
I had the phone for 2 weeks and the phone stopped charging.. Never will I ever purchase from this company again!! n
came apart after 90 days n
Terrible sale, LCD on screen went out 2 days after I got it in the mail. n
When the phone came, it looked good, but when I started to use it, all I got was a black screen, it would shut off when I was trying to work it, and I could not tell when a text came in or who was calling. n
Exactly as described. p
Great little phone p
Runs slow but enjoying at the moment n
Battery doesn't hold charge very long. Screen is already freezing n
wrong pin load n
good phone a little quirky at times p
thank you for the item p
Item as described but i hate the phone p
Trash n
Bad phone. Had to return. n
Phone works good but had more wear to it cosmetically than expected. p
Great phone p
The phone was exactly like the description. It works perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase . Thank you p
We got the phone faster than they anticipated. I is in near perfect condition, better than they described. It works great except the battery was shot - not unexpected for a phone this old. VERY HAPPY!! p
My daughter had an I Phone that was stolen and we needed to find her a phone. She was not a big fan of her I Phone and chose to try this one out. She absolutely loves it and it has everything she needs. Great phone. Wish I would have gotten it when I upgraded last summer!!! p
I'm an Android person and love the HTC Droid Incredible 2. This is my 3rd Incredible 2 and I will hate to have to change phones when it is not longer available! p
good p
2nd time around and I love this phone! The first phone messed up after 3 days but the second one hasn't messed up at all, bluetekusa were very considerate and made sure I was satisfied! p
Great phone! p
This was sold as a supposedly new phone but I doubt it. The packaging was tampered with and some of the accessories like the charger were not stock. Also, the lower part of the screen doesn't work well and everyone complains that the microphone doesn't work well - hard to hear what I am saying. So, I am pretty sure this is a refurbished handset.When I complained to the seller they offered to replace it for free and begged not to leave bad feedback. But I decided I couldn't be without a phone for a week while I waited for another one to arrive so I am just living with this partially functional phone until I get fed up and buy a new one. n
We bought this phone new. Had it about 5 months and it wont charge a battery. Tried different outlets and chargers and it will not charge. n
Very nice phone. Works well. It is very fast and it has an excellent camera. I have no complaints at all. p
I had this item like 2months and the battery port fried not very happy wouldn't let me return or even refund my money n
Taking time to learn to use my phone that is smarter than I am. I discover new ways to use it every day! p
Phone was fine just wasn't what I wanted after I saw it screen was not big enough it was a grest phone p
Price was right.All the possible features I thought necessary were included.Fully unlocked so works well with any carrier. p
Good phonetakes great pictures. Easy to useHad to download different ringtones and an app to keep alerting me when I have a text message p
I cannot say how much I LOVE this phone, it is fast,and with the mini sd card,has a big capacity for any app I want...LOVE this phone- great seller, great price! I debated between this,and the Motorola Droid3....(I wanted a 3g phone) The droid is ok, but this Phone has a WAY better camera,and much better processing speed than Droid3. p
everything i need nothing i dont good quality not the newest model for for age it is up to date for needs p
Phone was exactly as described. Came with 16 gig micro SD. Very easy to set up and use. would recommend to anyone who needs a replacement or a backup phone. p
I had the Droid Incredible 2 4G LTE, but it decided to take a swim and the screen stopped working. Needed a cheap replacement so picked this... Actually, I didn't realize it was different than the one I had until it came, I was rushing and didn't read the description carefully. At any rate, I actually think I like it a little better than the newer 4G LTE version. I don't even really notice the difference from 4G to 3G with this phone. Also, I really like that even when I don't have 3G service, I can still make calls. For some reason with the 4G version, if one thing went down the phone didn't work at all. I might even keep it a bit past my contract renewal date (July). p
Awesome 1st smart phone. I did my home work and it paid off big time. I love my Droid phone. p
Could not do anything, not even take pictures., sent it back and was out shipping costs 2 times!! n
This is a great phone and was better than expected. p
I do not understand because it says that its use is international if here in Venezuela can not fatal , I'm stuck with this phone , I ordered 2 above , I am very disappointed. n
ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ not good n
I am disappointed with my purchase through InstaTech.I purchased this phone from Insta-tech sometimes in January to replace the exact same model I previously owned. I activated the phone with Verizon sometimes in February. Since the activation, there were some annoying issues with this purchased unit - the date-time widget that comes with it normally displayed the min/max temperature based on location - on my previous phone: the new phone has a problem where it will not display the correct temperature. I can live with that since that is a minor issue.What is a problem is that this phone's display blanks out after a brief use - and with time this is getting worse. You could be talking, and in the middle of the conversation, the phone will turn blank, and the touch display will stop working, so you will not be able to disconnect the ongoing conversation, not view any new incoming calls OR even answer a call if there is an incoming phone call during this blanked out phase. The screen will reappear randomly after some time, but the duration is getting worse and worse.I was looking for a similar model to maintain the familiarity of the features between my old and new HTC model, but obviously it turned out to be a bad idea. What is more disappointing is the fact that the phone is proving unreliable within months of my purchase. If the vendor wanted to sell this item to the customers looking for it, they should have thoroughly tested it to make sure they are not selling a faulty product.Finally, I checked on Amazon today to see if I can return this phone - approx. 2 months since the phone activation - and of course, the return window has expired. I will be very careful purchasing future items from Insta tech. n
It's slow at times and it freezes, so I've had to take the battery out and put it back in just for it to work properly again. And the battery sucks! I can't even go a full school day without it dying, even when I have not used it at all. n
It will not connect with the Verizon network as promised. n
Good and affordable Smarth phone p
I received this phone two days after I ordered it. It perfectly replaces my old phone. p
returned to shipper. did not work. n
The phone that was delivered was said to be an 8 or 9 on a 10 point scale. It was more like a 2. I had the phone for maybe a week and it crashed on me at least 3 times. I'm dissatisfied to say the least. n
thank you for the item p
Works great and device looked brand new p
excelente p
I'm very happy with the purchase of this item,,, also had the best price and the p
THIS PHONE I GET ME A VERY DIFFERENT as described, 1) HOUSING HAVE ALL THE HORRIBLE 2) BATTERY IS NOT IS NOT EVEN ORIGINAL HTC 3) HAVE BAD CHARGING PORT . n
Looked very old and dirty for rating it as 93% . It was returned, Thanks. n
VERY GOOD PHONE. p
Didnt know it was a mini.. still 4 stars p
Cool for a 24yr old that thinks money grows on trees p
The phone is what it is. It's a generation or two or three or ten back smartphone. It has horrible battery life, because that's what was available when this phone was made. It is increasingly limited in apps because it's such an old model. But it works exactly as it is supposed to, and for that, I give it 5 stars. It is priced perfectly appropriately for its age and features. We had this model when it was new, and then passed it to the kids for the aps, and then I needed to replace one because I shattered the screen. Easy replacement.It did NOT have an SD card, and that may be a huge deal breaker. All I had to do was transfer over the card from the phone we already had. p
phone had more issues than described in add. buyer beware. n
I'm enjoying the phone p
loved it p
I received a phone with a screen that was not working. n
Was supposed to be a Verizon phone, but when I went to activate it Verizon couldn't identify it as Verizon. Spent a half an hour on the phone with them to no avail. A waste of $40.00 n
I received the phone on a Thursday and by Saturday the phone would not work, or should I say the battery would not remain charged. I would not recommend purchasing this phone n
"Used" phone-like new! Delivered as promised! Received ahead of schedule, the phone was in excellent condition. Fair price, for an "old" product(looks and operates like it's "brand-new"). Gotta hand it to chubbiestech! The only downside is how high the seller set the bar--now, they'll be expected to deliver the same result every time. Very satisfied... p
We've never bought phones online before and this phone was a really good deal. We like HTC and are still getting used to the Droid. p
I purchased this phone after using a Motorola Droid X for a short time. I really liked the Droid X, but it had serious battery/shutdown issues. I sent the X back and purchased the Incredible after reading much about it on various phone review sites. It received very high ratings, even getting a Cnet "phone of the year" rating.The phone is very fast, has a beautiful display, and is super easy to navigate. However, the battery life is dismal at best, even though i realize smartphones are battery killers. The battery life gets better if you shutdown all network data and wireless internet functions, but still goes down rather quickly after a few texts or calls.Another thing that was disappointing is the signal strength. Granted, I live in a rural area, but Verizon has good coverage in my area. It has been rare for me to see even 1 bar on the screen while in my area. Of course it gets better once I get closer to towns or cities, but I can't remember seeing full bars yet. I don't know what the answer is--I've even toyed with the idea of those "antenna booster" stickers that you place inside the phone or battery cover.Other than that, I really like the phone, and will keep it as long as it doesn't get worse :) p
i bought this to use as an mp3 player to save my iphone 5 from getting excessively worn out and because my nano didnt have built in bluetooth and it works really awesome p
Dosent hold a very good charge but other then that I love it .its really good ...and I love the screen size p
This is the most horrible phone I have purchased. Do not order from them, this phone is beyond glitchy they sent me a new battery and charger and the phone won't even come back on. I repeat do not order from these people. n
I loved the phone when i first got it. it came brand new and even with the original screen protector on it. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the charger quality. the phone came with a USB charger and a wall charger. first of all, the USB charger was defective. when i plugged it in it just kept switching out from charging the phone to not charging the phone. the regular wall charger worked perfectly fine until i had the phone for about a week. without warning the charger just stopped working on me. now i have to use a blackberry charger because it has the same charger import as this phone. OVERALL, it is a great phone. at first it was slow which is understandable because according to when the phone was released, the phone had been sitting of for 3 years. it kept freezing a few times a day for about 2 days because the phone had so many updates to install. IN CONCLUSION, ALTHOUGH IT MAY COME NEW OR USED THE CHARGERS MAY NOT WORK AND WILL PROBABLY STOP WORKING SOON AFTER YOU START USING THE PHONE. AND IT TAKES A FEW DAYS FOR THE PHONE TO "SETTLE IN" AND WORK PROPERLY p
I am not real impressed with this phone. It is chunky, the battery life is incredibly short, and it freezes up frequently. I wanted a phone for talking, texting, minimal web searching and facebook. It does all that, but not as stream-lined as I was hoping for. n
I have to take the battery out to work cause it sticks im going to return it not happy with it only thing good was it was delivered on time n
It has never worked since got it in mail, it is 2 year old phone is broken internally, and the case sent never fit the phone either. Thank you!!! n
2 of the phone come perfect, but one came to damage n
Very bad phone. Cannot store sim card. System updates a lot not a good phone at all thanks for wasting my time n money getting a refund n
The one I got failed. It would boot up , but then no activity or function. Was RETURNED. n
I bought this phone in a pinch when my cell phone broke and I wasn't due for an upgrade for a whole year. The phone lasted me almost that whole year, but unless you are facing a similar circumstance, I would NOT recommend buying this phone. It breaks quite easily, the battery life is abysmal, and as its condition deteriorates, it will sometimes refuse to turn on or charge. On multiple occasions, it actually erased all of the information on the micro-SD card which I put in it. On the upside, the screen is virtually shatter-proof. n
Absolutely beautiful - LIKE NEW - device delivered in just a couple of days.. Even came in an original HTC box, with and HTC charger and HYC USB cable! Wow!No instructions but I don't care. Any Google search would find more than I could ever want.Wonderful replacement for my six year old Incredible that finally crashed and burned. Great basic smartphone.Who needs Apple! p
nice phone p
Keeps shutting off randomly. A friend of mine said this was her favorite phone but did the same thing until one time it just didn't turn on anymore. Don't buy it. Pay a little more for a better phone. n
Working fine. Battery life is good. My son loves the phone. Get a sim card for more storage p
I love my new phone that I received. The price was fair. The phone arrived in a promptly manner. I would recommend this company to anyone because of their great professionalism p
great buy except for short battery life p
The first night I had this phoone, it kept going through reboot mode, I let it charge over night, sometime during the night it came on, the next day it was fine, that night it decided to go crazy again, I couldn't even get past the reboot to factory reset it , apparently this is an ongoing problem, Theirs so many problems with this phone, im really suprized they haven't recalled it. n
It's an easy to use phone, but the battery life stinks. It is also finicky about chargers and gets hot while charging. p
Had problems finding a phone that works on Page Plus. So I ordered this phone because I had one before on their network and I knew it works great. p
This phone is a durable phone and has a smaller screen than the iPhone which I like. What I do not like is the battery life. The battery lasts about 7 to 8 hours. I have had to plug my phone in every night and sometimes 2 times a day. But overall it is an average phone at best. n
I love the phone but am having issues with the phone. Sometimes when I call out or when someone calls me I cant hear anything. They can hear me but I cant hear them. n
Dealer sent me an inactive phone. It took 8 days to receive. When turning the power button on it would start up and immediately turn off. Not happy. n
I realize that this is an older product so this review is meant for those who need a replacement phone without a contract or just would like to have a back-up sitting around. I have only been using this phone for a few days now but I couldn't be happier just to be connected with the world again. I broke my phone a year off of my next upgrade and I wanted to buy a new phone from amazon to avoid ebay.Pros:CheapLightStylishNo contract requiredVerizon recently updated the OSCons:Smaller screen than I'm used toSlower than I'm used to (What can you expect with a 3 year old phone)Thick (Once again, it's a old phone so I can't complain)*Phone did not come with the 2GB sd card. There was no sd card included at all which is odd as the manual states that there should be a 2GB card already installed. I am using the 16GB card from my broken phone so it isn't a big deal for me but others may need the "included" card. p
It's a good phone, as all Droids are, but the only problem I had is pretty much a fatal one: Keyboard dead zone. I could not type 4-6 keys regularly in portrait mode (1 at all). Did the generic troubleshooting (battery pull, factory reset, screen clean, etc) to no avail. Even purchased a new keyboard app and used a free screen tester, which confirmed a dead zone in a column around the "Y" key in portrait mode, which explains why unlocking the phone is difficult (I seem to use that column to drag down). Hopefully this isn't a recurring problem with most phones, will update when replacement from seller comes in the mail. n
After two problems with phone, the vendor refunded my money without complaint. The got a Samsung Galaxy from local cell store, and it has issues too.I've learned my lesson: It Apple iPhone for me from now on. n
The Product is good but my battery isnt no good it charge 100% and then go dead when i take it off the charger n
OK phone p
Phones ok ... n
Phone never worked n
My son phone did not last due to heat with the battery and I didn"t know If I should had return it or not No Label Return I Didn"t have in my order.. p
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY IT WORKS. n
When I ordered the phone it was supposed to be a new phone. It was not worth paying for.I could have paid for a newer phone with my insurance. The battery was no good and the wall charger did not work.What I paid for was junk. n
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in fan. p
did not work bad battery n
great transsacsation!!!! p
This phone sucks.I can't connect to Wi-Fi.Maps is all over the place.Forget about a good facebook experience.Most apps that I am still able to download don't even work.Don't waste your time.This phone can't keep up with current technology. n
this phone is horrible it only lets you download one app after that it says the storage spaces low even after I put an SD card in it. I hate this phone I wish I would have never got it. and the calibration on the phone is way off it always clicks on different apps even when I'm not touching it. n
The day I bought this phone I was searching for a 4g smart phone, and 4g aondroid phone and the search brought me to the HTC incredible. The reason I would have givin it 2 1/2 stars is this phone is a 3g. At the Same time I ordered a 4g sim card which I ended up giving it away. n
He broke it even with it suppose to be tough. 80 y.o. had hard time using n
I bought this phone thinking it would be a great choice, after reading the reviews. I was however very disappointed. The first day I got it, it worked perfectly fine. Was smaller than I thought it was going to be. However that is not the case. It shuts off and on all the time. The battery is shot that is for sure. I had it on the charger the whole night and took it off and headed to work and five mins later the phone was dead. I have been without a phone for three days now and I ordered a new phone off my phone carrier website. if you want a good phone do not order one off amazon it is very misleading. Do not waste your money! n
Phone was used camera didnt work not happy got stuck with it...I n
Absolutely crummy phone. Slow.. freezes up and restarts all the time. Bad battery life, camara stinks .... Close to the worst phone I've ever owned! n
I got this phone turned it on and started setting it up within about 20 minites it shut off just get the 2nd version of this phone the screen is a little bigger and its a hell of a lot more reliable n
It stinks. Its to slow and doesn't have enough memory n
the phone is malfuctioning and turns off by its self and constantly locks up n
This is what I need. It is small, lightweight, durable, it has been reliable and does not burn through battery power. This is for someone who wants the availability of web use but uses it only occasionally. Not a lot of memory for downloads. I buy my phones and use Page Plus to keep costs minimal. p
I purchased this phone for my dad as a replacement. Once I received it, I fell in love with it myself. I didn't want to give it to him. But it is a great phone. p
placed order for phone it arrived on time. but it is refurbished has water damage and screen freezes up cannot answer calls some times as well.This phone was sold as new condition and is far from that! n
This phone arrived and seemed fine. Within two weeks the screen went black and was inoperable. I went to my local Verizon store and they said they had seen this before, it was a hardware problem. I am in the process of trying to return the phone and get my money back. n
A great buy for my son who lost his phone...again...it beats buying brand new from Verizon which means you renew your contract for another two years. p
While I am happy for the unexpected upgrade, the description on the phone said htc incredible. It is actually an incredible 2. I had already purchased phone covers for the original incredible. Now I have 5 phone covers I cant use :(. Also, it came with the wrong phone charger. The charger that was sent with the phone is too big to use. Thankfully, it fits in my husbands charger. Also, personal texts, pictures and phone numbers and also personal account info was left on the phone.. Luckily, I am a good person and erased everything. n
I ordered a HTC droid incredible from seller K&K reality. The phone arrived within the timeframe listed by amazon/seller. The phone did not work at all, it would not boot and just continually shut itself off. I consulted with a seemingly knowledgeable person at a verizon store who told me it wasn't a software problem. Included with my phone was a piece of paper asking me to respond to k@k reality directly so they could address my problems if I had any. I did so and recieved no response. I contacted them through Amazon and again recieved no response (this all occurred months ago). I forgot about it, took it as a loss and bought another phone and I am satisfied with it. Yesterday, I recieved a hilarious email from kk reality requesting and I quote, for me to "PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE" respond with a positve review if in fact I had a positive experience as Amazon is reviewing their account. I never write reviews and did not want to type away and complain. However, this the only problem I have had when purchasing anything from amazon. I understand buying used items is risky. However, the fact that I was just ignored by the seller and the email they sent begging me review their item is the reason for this scathing review. If I were able to give them negative stars I would as I am in the red around $100.00. n
This is the worst phone ever...it repeatedly and randomly reboots, it will not hold an app (displays the white/green droid even after redownload/install), drops my gmail account and music, and cannot take a photo without holding the screen down for more than 15 seconds...way after the event.I've had a few phones in my time and 'get' that all electronics are subject to aging or owner-abuse but this phone never ever worked properly. I do not recommend this phone and would give a 5 negative stars if it were an option. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE! You will be sorry. I know I am. n
phone arived early, works great have it on prepay verizon ,best phone for the job,lot of acceseries otter box has good cases p
Lost my blackberry so decided to get a droid. Bought an HTC Incredible. Listed as "used" when I opened the package, it was still in the original box! And it came right on time. Verison activated it for free so I was able to keep my plan the same. All is good! p
Bought this for my son. It is his second one. To say it took a lickin and kept on tickin would be an understatement. Until he finally smashed the screen out of it, it was battered and bruised but would still make a call. Nice screen size too. I have a Droid X. It's too big to carry easily. Great for nav screen,not so much for phone. This seems to be a better all around phone. Bit out of date now though. p
Went to activate the phone and couldn't. Phone had been reported stolen. n
This phone was horrible from the moment I received it. Granted it was not brand new, but I could hardly make calls because it will cut off on its own. I never knew when that would happen. It finally just died, so now I'm in the process of getting a refund. n
Phone kept restarting and would only stay on while charging or on an almost full battery. n
At least it arrived when it said it would. That's the only thing that worked out!! n
This phone started malfunctioning after 30 days. The charger stopped working in even less time than that. Do your research before buying. n
Terrible phone, ended up giving it away. n
Poor quality android. n
arrived in very good condition, like new and included very happy to buy this phone original charger, somewhat smaller but is relevant was that there bino with screws p
Had nothing but problems but got a refund in the end n
Sucks n
I purchased this phone after I dropped and cracked the screen of my Samsung3 (still had 6 months remaining until I could upgrade). This phone was a huge disappointment. It was very slow, dropped calls often, and did not hold a charge very well. I ended up going back to my broken phone until my upgrade became available. The only good thing about it was its compact size. n
I received my phone extremely fast which was a plus. I transferred my Verizon Service Plan and everything was great until the battery started to die. I plugged the charger in and nothing happened. The phone died completely. I tried to charge it using the port on the computer, nothing. I received a replacement charger and battery but again the same thing happened, the battery died and would not charge. It appears that the charging port on the phone is not compatible with the charger it comes with. So, I just wanted to let everyone know that the wall phone adapter that comes with this phone does not work well for the HTC Droid Incredible 4G LTE phone. A battery charger is a better option! It works excellent with the Travel Wall Charger and 2 Batterries for Sprint HTC Evo 4G, HTC Hero, Droid Incredible, Imagio, Ozone, Snap, Tilt 2, Verizon Droid Touch Pro 2 Sold by Liquidation Direct. The phone itself is not broke, the charging port on the phone is the issue. I just had to pay extra for battery charger but it came with two extra batteries as a bonus to switch out while the other is charging. This is actually a great phone! The adapter that comes with the phone is not compatible..Try a battery charger before sending the phone back! p
I received this cell phone two days ago and I have already experience some difficulties with the phone. The next day my phone ran out of battery so I connected the charger to my phone. My phone still does not turn on. I don't know why, the charger works fine, but the cell phone itself does not. I tried pressing the power button and the volume button at the same time to reset the phone but it did not work. I will like to receive a replacement for the phone or a full refund. Thank you. n
this phone was a waste of my money, and it will be yours too if you buy it, It is slow outdated and more than half the time does not work. n
This phone broke after two weeks. It wouldn't keep a charge and now one of my sons Xmas presents is broke after spending 80.00 n
It's a good phone. The battery is fairly long-lasting; I'm not a big apps, games, or music person on my phone, so battery-life is decent. Now if I could just find a case that fits it and one I like! p
Best CELL PHONE I've owned, more features than anyone could want and they all work.cannot go wrong with the nameINCREDIBLE. p
Overall the phone is good.I don't know if it was the phone or me, but the battery dies very quickly. n
After years of a flip phone I decided to get my son an upgrade... Hope he doesn't blow it with my data plan p
I needed to replace a phone that was no longer working properly. I didn't want a different phone, just the same one I was happy with and familiar with. This is a brand new phone that is functioning perfectly. It certainly saved me hundreds of dollars, now that the phone companies are charging full price for their phones. p
I bought this phone as a Christmas gift. I was so happy w/the price, and the delivery time. Gave it to my daughter early, because her phone wasn't working at all. Less than 24 hours after I gave her the phone, it wouldn't charge or turn on. I sent it back, and emailed the seller to make sure we would get her replacement before we went home for Christmas. I was told they would send me the replacement on Monday. Instead, Late afternoon Monday, I get an email that my card was refunded. In which, I don't yet see the refund on my card. Not happy with this sale at all. n
I can't say I hate it, but I do dislike it. This is my first smartphone and I can honestly say there are better phones out there. It dies too fast, you turn it off and you have to turn it off multiple other times to make it work right, the apps don't work good after you turn it off, and it glitches a lot. I don't recommend buying it.. Not worth it. n
Purchased this to replace a lost phone and did not have the funds to upgrade and do not want to loose my unlimited data plan w/ Verizon. Would give it a 5 but it is difficult to turn on most of the time. The button on the top of the phone is very small. Otherwise it works great and is just what I was expecting for an older model smart phone. p
Phone works but the battery needed replacing. A new battery was not provided. There was also a chip of plastic missing from the phone in the corner. Although its purely cosmetic. n
Went through 3 of these in 3 months because it was just one defect after another. I was trying to get by purchasing this phone until I was eligible for my upgrade with Verizon since my LG phone was barely functioning (as in it wasn't even connecting to make phone calls anymore), but this phone kept randomly shutting down (all 3 of the ones I got) and there was just a myriad of other problems all along the way. The day I was eligible for my upgrade, I went out and got a new phone. Oh, and the random reboots that occurred every night at about 3am and lasted for about 10-20 minutes (continuous reboots) with no explanation or way to make it stop. n
Purchased this as a replacement phone for my son who has a propensity of cracking the screens on his phones (this is his 3rd phone). We're happy with the phone so far and I was pleased with the way it arrived packaging wise and that it had a charge. I was also pleased it arrived substantially earlier than it was originally supposed to as the seller upgraded the shipping method. All in all, it was a very good experience with this purchase. p
This came exactly as described! No scratches (that are easily visible). Phone works properly! Overall a great phone to get me to my new phone upgrade in a few months. p
Had for month if that and screen cracked. Was texting and it just cracked right down the middle. No Buenos. n
The place I got it from said it was in excellent condition and it obviously wasnt. The phone freaked out all the time and I still haven't been able to get a new phone cause this company has put me behind with a crappy phone. n
Wasn't the phone I thought was, and also didn't know out had been used and not brand new..I was looking for a prepaid phone for my daughter and was very upset when I tried to set it up that it was a contact phone. When I called too find out about returning out the man Sayyid I had to pay a restock fee..so I'm out shipping and restock fee...wasn't happy at all! n
I got this because of the phone plan I was going to use. My daughter picked the style and the price was right. Haven't had any problems. p
Phone is great and it was a surprise for my husband. I have been trying to get him off his flip phone and now i have success. It took him time to learn to use it but he now loves it. Grandkids are happy to because he will text them more than before. LOL p
I hate the screen. I hate the battery life, the way it feels, and the cost for something that doesn't really "do" anything. Phones are a waste of time, and money. ...This is my second Droid in 2 years... I buy them because they're absolutely the BEST. (No phone is perfect) p
this phone was great I lovee it but the battery goes really fast if on internet for a bit but other then that it was a great buy. p
The phone is solid and works well. The battery is TERRIBLE!! With No apps installed the battery only lasted 4-5 hours unused. I bought an extended battery and NOW its great n
This phone should have never been sold. From the first time I turned it on it continually rebooted. I search for solutions and tried everything to fix it myself but no luck. Luckily I can return it for a refund but I wouldn't buy used from this seller again. It was a waste of my time and the product should have had the most basic testing before it was resold. I'll probably lose my shipping cost for the privelege of recieving a worthless phone. n
I bought this phone and with in a week it was messed up.... Im NOT AT ALL HAPPY about it. n
I was disappointed on the size. But it works great and it is a great phone. Touch Screen and Clarity. n
Yes I'm very happy with my new phone. The price was great & Verizon gave me an unlimited plan within my budget. p
The phone was listed in very good shape and I would consider it to be okay. The charger didn't work without messing around with it to get it to actually charge. Luckily, I had another charger available that worked properly. The phone itself was in okay shape, but it was missing a chunk out of the side of the back cover. There was also a lot of dust stuck in the back of the phone under the back cover. Overall, the phone was in worse shape than I expected. n
The phone is great was just as we anticipated would use them again The phone was boxed just as they said...Thanks p
The phone is way too small and has a really old operating system. I definitely will be finding a replacement or just reactivating my old phone. Very disappointed. n
In the instruction manual you can put a Sims card in clearly you can't! I want to returnfor a 4g n
it was a good replacement phone but the phone kept restarting and hearing droid all night was annoying but still a good phone n
Phone dies anytime I use it, won't hold a charge, bit mark on the battery, charger that it came with has a short in it somewhere. n
Bought this just food using as an mp3 player to listen to music while exercising and biking and it does the job very well, over great media devices alternatives p
The phone was practically brand new. Exactly as stated. No scratches,fast internet browser and apps .works great. shipping went as expected. p
its been a good phone so far its my first smart phone great phone to learn on till I can upgrade p
No front facing camera and no option for a signature for my messages...constantly freezing and cutting off by itself as if its refurbished ;( when it suppose to be brand new n
very nice experience and the phone was all it was advertised to be. I am very happy with my experience. p
I hate this phone!!!!! It was all peaches and cream the first couple days.... then the screens started to jump in and out, then my apps kept shutting down, then it said UID's are inconsistent. I took it to Verizon and they didn't even know what that meant. My phone ended up erasing everything and I had to end up restoring my entire phone to the factory settings. THIS PHONE SUXXXXXXX n
Got this phone for my husband after his broke. Although it is a bit smaller than his previous phone, he has found it works really well and meets all his needs. Phone was as described, professionally packed and arrived quickly. p
The phone itself works fine however the battery life on it is terrible. If you are actively using your phone throughout the day you will need to charge it at least twice. n
My phone arrived before the promised date. I have had no problems with it at all. There are very little scratches on it, I was surprised. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a good phone. p
phone is unuseable except for making & receiving calls. A verizon store checked it & said the home button is malfunctioning so the screen changes constantly. Unable to text or get vmails. n
Phone appeared to be in good shape and came with new looking battery and charger. Powered up OK and all was going fine until the display screen timeout function turned the display off. Could not get the display to come back on using the power button on top. I could see the power button was working because the Home, Menu, Return and Search buttons would light up below the screen.To get the display to come back on I had to remove and reinstall the battery. Tried to find settings that may be affecting the functionallity of the screen timeout, but after having to R&R the battery several times to recover from screen timeout, I determined the phone was defective and returned it.Not sure who did the refurbishment on this phone but I ordered one from another seller that is supposed to be "factory" refurbished. Hope that one works as it should!! n
This phone does everything I need or want. It was easy to setup and call quality is fine.It is large enough toeasily text.I got this phone so I could switch to PagePlus service. At $12/mo. I get 250 call minutes, 250 txt messages, and minimal data (10 mb). I simply set the phne data off and use wifi only.If there is any problem it is battery life. So, turn off wifi and bluetooth and it is much better.Battery life is no problem it you use this as a phone only.I get all the features of an android phone for $12/mo. without the expensive data plan required every other cell phone service provider p
Mostly the phone works fine but recently the camera app stopped working for absolutely no reason. Even a factory reset of the phone did not fix it. When the app is opened, the screen turns black and a white camera icon appears, as normal, but the screen stays black and none of the touch buttons work. You can put the phone to sleep and bring it back with the top power button, or turn the phone off, but otherwise the phone is stuck in limbo until the battery is removed and reinserted. We've only had the phone for a week so this is definitely something that is not our fault -- I would just return it for a replacement, as I'm sure it's just a minor defect in the phone, but when I go to return it, no matter what I choose as the reason for return, Amazon greys out the option to receive a replacement, because "We only offer replacements if the return is as a result of our error (e.g., item arrived damaged or was lost)". That's ridiculous. This is clearly an item that has a fault, since it's a software issue and nothing is physically broken, and it's Amazon's or the seller's job to make sure I don't have to go six days without a phone or pay return shipping.Also, the battery only lasts three hours, and once it gets to <15% you can watch it go from 15 to 10 to 5 to 0 in about 20 minutes. But I was willing to put up with it until the camera issue. n
. I got the phone for my son. say he is having difficulty with the applications, could not delete still learning the phone n
This phone can't go more than two hours even on standby without being on a charging source. Now, to be fair, it IS an older model phone for todays apps and I DO run a good many apps on it. The memory could be better (more) since about once a week the battery needs removed and replaced to unfreeze it, but it does have it's good points.1. It was inexpensive. It's an older model phone with 3G connection rather than the 4G of the newer phones, so the price is a bit less.2. The display is surprisingly clear.3. It's relatively fast in processing the apps installed until it freezes.4. it's not big and clunky, yet not too small to be productive. I got this one for my girlfriend as a replacement for a flip phone and to keep the cost down until the contract allowed for a newer replacement. The smaller screen size allows it to be a little less cumbersome to carry in a pocket or holster than my Razr Maxx, which tends to dig in to my side while driving if it's in the holster, or not fit in a pocket with the Otterbox Defender on it.This thing was good for the reason I purchased it, but had there been a better deal on a newer model phone that has better battery quality, I'd definitely go with the newer generation of phone. n
i was confuse with this phone i was thinking that it was other one so i retuned i tried a little bit. p
Wow, I can't say enough good things about this phone. It is fast, good sized dispay, responsive, and great graphics. The design isn't that great though, and it's a pretty plain phone. But it is totally worth the $91 I spent on it. The battery is okay, but not the best. Overall, I love this phone!! p
My phone came within 3 business days. It was brand new as expected, Verizon worked really well with me for getting all my info backed up and transfered. Have to charge it twice a day but whats new, with any phone. First time buying a phone outside carrier. Saved like 400.00. I'll do it again in the future! p
i recieved the package back in july 2012, needless to say i am not a happy custumer,problems with the phone and battery from day one. n
At first everything worked fine but when I started turning it off and on it will never turn on. It's like It would start over wen I try to turn it on n
The phone is very light and easy to use. The battery however dies way too fast. I could have a full charge i send three texts and its down halfway. The back of the phone never really closes so it pops off easily. The camera is ok but takes too long to work by the time it clicks my kids have already moved. I wouldnt get this phone again if i could go back. Nothing special at all. n
This was the worst. I was not satisified with this product. I wish thete was a way that I could return it n
Great product. I was in need of replacing my old one and this one met my needs. It was even in better condition than I expected, and I received it earlier than expected. p
the phone was in great reconditioned shape, no problems with the phone, justs needs extended battery because standard battery doesn't last p
Was forced to buy a non contract phone so I did what everyone else does went on amazon picked out what I thought and read was a good used phone. First call I made and every call since then has to be on speaker because the speaker that is used to hold the phone to your ear does not work and battery dies out with in hour and half had smart phones before with batteries that lasted longer than that n
Never did I think I'd find a phone I loved....I just did. Excellent phone. I'd recommend it to anyone, and the seller was very prompt. p
Phone is in great working conditon. Ive had this phone about a month and i have not had any issues with it. I would without a doubt buy from this seller again. p
The description listed this phone as new, but upon trying to activate it, I learned that it was in fact a used phone. I still like the phone, but would have appreciated little honesty in the marketing process along with a price break that accompanies used merchandise. n
Very good phone, with lots of features. Battery life seems a bit weak. call quality is good. Screen is very nice. Overall a pretty decent phone at a great price. p
Not the newest phone out there, but bought this to have a phone for my second line. I don't have many complaints, its hard to compare to my other phone on my main line, and iphone 4, its definitely more advanced. but this phone works well and I missed the abilities of having android p
Good job .I have to say I was not sure about this device because it seemed very small. See my Samsung fascinated broke and I needed a replacement I look at The Droid x.and this and the Droid x was too big for me hut this seemed too small I decided on this because it was cheap and I was getting pretty much everything I had on my previous phone.Tue phone was delivered 2 days before expected in great condition. It came with a case, screen protector on it and 2 extra screen protectors also the charger and the original box.I have had this phone for a week now and it is great it was a little small at first but I just had to get used to it. The camera is amazing the screen looks great and i love the UI. It was alot different than touchwiz I had on the fascinated but it wasn't hard to figure out.All in all its a great replacement phone for someone look for a replacement phone and doesn't want to pay a lot or just needs something until their contract is up. p
Well, first off, the original product I received from them was defective - power button didn't work, but other than that the phone worked and looked excellent. The minute I figured out the phone was defective, I called them up, and got Jason. He was very helpful and nice, and when I told him what was wrong with the phone, he told me to go ahead and email me the details and he would ship me the exchange item along with a return envelope for the broken phone. That was Friday, so first thing Saturday morning, I got the email with a tracking number for the phone. Since it was the weekend, I had to wait until 5 days later, on Wednesday to get it. Once it finally came, I found the new phone to be in WORSE cosmetic condition than the defective one I originally got. I also noticed as well that the screen had been replaced; this was noticeable because it was very minutely elevated, and the tracking button really had to be pressed down by the skin of my finger to click it. Not that big of a deal, but it lowers the value of the phone considerably if the screen has been replaced, and what's more if it's noticeable. Also, the piece o' junk charger they included with the original phone causes the new phone to completely shut off - I have to take out and replace the battery in order for it to boot back up - and it doesn't even actually charge it!Better luck next time, SoonerSoft... n
A refurbished model yet working beautifully. This is much better than the brand new Samsung phone I had purchased from the Verizon store. p
This phone arrived on time from the seller, as described and everything. The phone is exactly what I needed for my new job. The camera is good, it takes great pictures. The screen looks good and has good clarity. The phone is hard to bog down using a number of different apps. The only downside is that the battery took a while to charge (I charged it for about 18 hours yesterday and it got full, but that might be because it was new). All in all, a great phone. p
htc droid incredible is a nice upgrade from the htc eris i used for two years, i like to buy the phones new out of contract once they become slightly outdated , they still work great but i don't pay full price or get locked in. so far the incredible has been very reliable and easy to use, battery life is just fine , i use the advanced app killer all the time. so far so good, i think one thing people fail to remember is that these are phones with small batteries that some ask to do the things of a laptop all day that has a battery 100x the size . realistic expectations are required and you will be satisfied with your smart phone. p
Do not purchase this phone. The battery life sucks and the memory is limited. I believe they knew this when they sold me the phone. n
doesnt work... n
Charger did not work n
The phone would not charge up. I even bought another battery, the phone turned on but it would not charge the battery. I was sold a piece junk and was greatly inconvenienced, by not having an operating phone for over a week. n
It's barely gets a one star from me. Maybe it's because I'm used to 4g phones, I had no idea it was a 3g or so small. So never ever again will I be so careless when buying a phone online without calling customer service first to get every little spec. n
the battery life is not good at all. n
Great phone p
don't buy. It died and I could not get a new battery. I had a lot of pictures that I wanted badly and now they are lost forever. Awful phone. I don't think they even make them anymore. n
Decent phone, good price. p
It not serve my purpose, I thought I could use my sim card from Simple Mobile with the cell, but that was not the case. Money wasted. n
Since I was still under contract but too poor to replace my phone, which I gave to my daughter when hers fell into water, I researched used phones. I was hoping this one would hold me through until next Fall when I can upgrade. My only concern was that the 3g would be slower and the battery would be poor. I must say that this phone e is so wonderful, that I am happy to have given away my newer Samsung. The concerns I had were unfounded, as my battery fully lasts a day and a half with normal use (I do not live on it though). I use it to fill in my gaps when I am not at home using my tablet (Nexus Google...excellent tablet). The 3g is just as fast as what I had experienced before with my other smart phone and the sensors on the screen make the touch navigation quick and pleasant. I am overjoyed with this purchase and with the professional service of my seller. p
first phone worked for awhile but service was great when it had to be returned, and the second phone has been working ever since would buy again p
When considering to buy from this company, always remember it may take a while for them to contact you back if they do at all. I still have not talked to apple wireless, and I called them personally. Someone's voice mail answered it was clearly a personal cell phone. I am not happy at all. I am out of 90$ and I refuse to pay to send this phone back to them. This company should really make this right. I am a student I need a working phone. I am so sad. n
Blanks in and out when talking. No storage and slow internet connection . Can't find many accessories. Battery life is low n
I had an issue with my order at first, but the dealer did everything they could in a timely manner to get this issue resolved and since i had the issue the dealer gave me a free case for the inconvience i had. :) p
I recommend this phone to those who need a smart phone but don't want to pay the high iphone price. I am still trying to get used to how this phone works ( as with any cell phone) but the one thing that I do not particularly like is that after taking five photos, the phone restarts itself.If i take pics as if I were going to attach them to a message then the camera is fine. Weird, but the phone is still good. n
it doesnt work it turns off alot i dont like it !that was some waste of money ! >:( n
I like the phone, it is a nice size and easy to use. Also found a case that fit perfectly. p
This was my first smart phone and I love it, I am going to by my son one for his birthday it is such a good phone for the price p
I like the phone but there is better out there. It won't let me send videos in a text message or post videos to instagram, so I was a little disappointed in that. All in all its pretty good though. n
Would give no Stars if i could!!! Phone's were extremely glitchy. Couldn't even type a text message. On top of that, wasn't able to return the phones due to a time restrictive return label. n
VERY dissatisfied! Screen will not stop flashing, flash light turns on by itself, cannot access any apps, cannot receive or make any calls or texts. Phone worked for a short period of time and now is not usable. Also, it wasn't mentioned in the description that a charger would be needed. n
This is a piece of TRASH & I HATE this phone...will never buy this kind AGAIN...ðŸ‘ŽðŸ˜¡ðŸ’” n
Excellent!! Product arrived sooner than expected and it works perfect. Order one today! p
Great phone, it served its purpose. p
just as described p
perfect p
Crappy phone n
After activation, it wouldnt come back on and still wont come on. n
Great phone p
Product met the expectation, overall. It took some adjusting as it was a downgrade (slightly smaller and slower, etc.) from the HTC I2 previously owned, had the components (data option, camera, ample storage space, a load of desirable options, etc.) most wanted in the product. The power button is in the spot that is normally where you would hold the phone especially while taking pictures, readjusting is needed to prevent accidentally turning off the phone (the I2 corrected this). Has some of the same port problems that HTCs are somewhat known for and was the ultimate nail in the coffin for my prior phone. This one's working best to charge in the horizontal position versus stand-up; Also, a cheap and efficient battery charger has been purchased that charges the battery by taking it out of the phone and placing it in the charger to decrease ware on the phone's charging port. p
I received the HTC Droid Incredible in about 4 days. I was very excited to get it all set up but to no avail, after about 2 hrs on the phone with Verizon, I was told that it was not a clean phone and could not be used! NOT HAPPY! I sent it back and did get my $ refunded to my account! Now I'm still stuck with the stupid Blackberry Bold! n
I have had the Droid Incredible for a little over a year at the time of this review. I believe that I have a good "feel" for this phone now that I've used it for a while, and my summary is that I don't think it deserves the title "Incredible". To clarify my review, I am reviewing both the phone and the operating system (Android 2.3.4 on my device). I think reviewing the operating system is applicable because HTC has its own custom flavor of Android installed (HTC Sense) and that plays a part in how the phone functions (or not). I'm also using it on a prepaid carrier. Here's my breakdown:The good:1. It's a smartphone that runs Android which has a lot of free apps versus the competition.2. Voice quality is good, I've never had a problem with this. It's a phone after all!3. It records HD video.4. This is a smaller Android phone than others so it is more portable. It fits in my pocket nicely.5. Standby battery life is good if you turn everything off like data, wi-fi, etc.6. I like using my phone as a navigation device, and this phone has standalone GPS which is great. No need to have a cell signal/data connection if you use offline maps.7. 3.5mm headphone jack.8. Flashlight (I use it more than you think).The bad:1. Freezes WAY too often. This is my main issue with the phone, and I would give it another star if this freeze issue didn't exist. Freezing once in a while and having a reboot solve the problem is one thing. I'm talking about the phone freezing and then having to reboot several times before the phone decides to work again. I'm at the point where I'm afraid of turning the phone off because I will have to reboot several times until it decides to stop freezing. Trust me when I say I have done hours of research on how to fix this, and tried all sorts of tricks, with no success.2. Battery life drains quickly if you have connections like 3G enabled or watch video. My opinion about battery life is that you should be able to leave your data connection on all day and not run out of battery. This is actually rather common with a lot of older Android phones so I can't fault the HTC Incredible too much, I just live with it. My main gripe is that my "smart" phone is a dumb phone when I have to keep data and other services turned off most of the time so I can get through the day without recharging. I can't use features like voice search or voice text or push email without having to turn the data connection back on (because I'm conserving battery again). The push email works if you "manage" your battery, meaning you have an app turn on your connection every so often.3. Has too little phone memory and application data storage compared to how much storage there is on an SD card. What I mean is that I am using a 32gb SD card, with 25gb of free space left. I still have over 6gb of internal storage because I install all my apps on the SD card. However, I only have 99mb of phone memory left and 33mb of application data storage left. What this means is that I get a "low space" notification and can't install new apps or even update some of the larger apps on my phone (which by the way are all on the SD card) without uninstalling something. Again I have done tricks like deleting all my texts, killing apps, clearing the cache etc which frees up space but it still doesn't solve my "low space" problem.CONCLUSION: Overall, this is not a bad phone, but the "deal killer" for me is that the phone freezes a lot. I can adjust to things like low space or short battery life, but a phone that freezes even in the middle of a phone call is not good. I want to like this phone, and kind of do, but HTC could have done better with a phone named "Incredible". n
the HTC incredible is a good for and fills all the needs I have for a phone. If you are looking for a super tech style phone then this is not your phone but you already know that. I love the camera on it and Verizon has great reception. What really impressed me was the shipping of the phone. I bought the phone at 8:05 on a Wednesday morning and it was at my door by 10am on Thursday. over all I am very happy p
but the charger doesn't fit into the port and doesn't charge the phone. unfortunately i returned it. but the phone itself was great. n
I had this type of phone a few years ago when it was a new model. I was very happy THEN. My current phone died and so I thought I would go back to it because I am not currently eligible for and upgrade. The 1st phone I received from this supplier "Cell Lounge Inc" was defective right out of the box and the second one stopped working about 6 wks later ( their policy is 30 days). Frustrated that the supplier just washed their hands of me after only having the phone for about 6 weeks. They are sending me to the manufacturer. So, I'm not sure if I'm mad at the supplier or the maker of the phone.UPDATE: I would NEVER purchase from this supplier EVER again!!! The manufacturer requires that if a phone is sent back with in the 1 year warranty period that the receipt that came with the phone has the serial # printed on it. This didn't occur with this supplier AND they are not willing to help at all. They will take your money and move on!!! n
Had to charge it every four hours..... I only had the phone for a month and my battery died.... pieces of s*** n
My DROID INCREDIBLE is incredible! I LOVE THIS PHONE! It does everything I need it to do! My options and extras are AMAZING! p
The Phone looks to be ok but the battery was bad and I have to get a new one.Not real happy about that n
The phone has been a great intro to smart phones. It does what I expected and then some. I recommend it! p
the phone works great,showed up on time, and was new as advertised. However it was not made clear that this is a droid incredible VERSION ONE. Im sure this is part of the reason for the low price, however it made buying accessories more difficult. p
Good phone, good size, provides what I need. If someone calls I don't always hear them or they can't hear me. Not sure if that's the phone or service. p
The phone works great. No problems so far and everything came neatly packaged. Only problem I've had so far is that the guide for using the phone wasn't for my specific phone. I had to figure out how to take the back of on my own. Other than that, no regrets. p
After an initial call to Verizon to get the phone added so that I could activate it, it was up and running. I havn't had any issues with battery drain more than typical use. If I play games and talk on the phone all day, I'm guaranteed to have my battery run down, but that's true of any phone.I played with the HTC UI, but out of habit, I downloaded an alternate interface that looks glorious on the screen.There's plenty of room for my apps, which my previous phone didn't... But I still have a 32 GB sd card to hold everything.The only thing I need to get used to is the touch keyboard, but that's more of a personal preference as opposed to a downside of the phone. p
I have another one that is why I ordered a second. A good phone that is reasonably priced. The Incredible is just that. p
I loved my old phone but was reluctant to get a new one through my carrier because I wanted to keep my low monthly contracted amount so decided to buy it outright. This was the best price given on-line so I decided to order it. Though the 1st one arrived with a battery unable to take a charge, as soon as I contacted the seller the item was promptly replaced at no cost to me and the seller checked to see if I was happy with replacement. That meant a lot to me!!!! Things happen and products can be defective no matter where you buy them. I was quite impressed with the ease in which the seller corrected the problem for me. Highly recommend and will definitely use this seller again. p
Bought as a replacement for the one I already had. It took quite some abuse, as I am not that gentle with the phones. I also bought the OtterBox Defender Series Shield for this new one.. works quite well together. Three of us in the family have this phone and really like it a lot. p
I bought this phone for my wife and she loves it. I have an HTC Trophy, but if I were going to have a Droid phone this would be it. There are some bad reviews for some refurbished phones of this model, but this one was brand new and has none of those issues. Everyone I know that has ever had this phone and got rid of it wishes they had it back. I know there are faster (4G) phones out there, but this phone and my Trophy are excellent phones that do everything we need them to do. I think that HTC overall makes good devices. Just try to find a new one. p
I purchased this phone for my son as a Christmas gift. He was not eligible for an upgrade so I decided to take a chance on this rather than pay the $400 for a new one through Verizon. I was never able to get it activated. We spent two hrs on the phone with tech support and was told that the software was outdated and would not allow it to be activated. They suggested we take it to a Verizon store. Another two hrs waiting, only to find out there was nothing they could do on their end either. They were nice enough to get my son a different phone free of charge. I'm sure the problem was random, but my son had to wait three days to enjoy his Christmas gift. n
Didn't think I'd have to spend over an hour cleaning out someone else's pics, video's, and texts. I was not happy at all with this product. n
I felt it was a disappointing phone and have since stopped using it and purchased another phone. n
Looks cool but it is a peice of sh*t this modle has a restart problem wereit wont stop resarting stayaway from this garbage n
I like the HTC Inc2! p
didnt last long.....few months, and it went crazy. n
Not much memory and has problem with wall chargers. Needs to be restarted frequently. n
if you like small smarthphones is is great!!! but if you use it a lot and want the battery last, you may want something bigger!! The phone is decent the 5star is for the seller!! p
I purchased HTC Droid through Sold By: Equipment Blowouts Inc and month and half later the phone stopped working. They wanted me to pay to ship plus pay to fix it. I paid $61.50 for it. So now I'm without money and the phone. Very disappointed. n
I got this phone for my son. I didn't want to spend a lot of money since this was going to be his first phone. This phone is horrible. I wouldn't recommend it. It quite working after 5 months. It will not turn on, hold a charge or anything. The SD card got damaged, so he lost all of his videos and pictures(which he cried about for a while). If your doing to purchase this phone all I have to say is good luck. n
HTC is a respectable brand with a lot of intriguing additional widgets. My only peeve is the occasional freezing up when dialing and texting with the only remedy is to reboot. n
Purchased to use on Page Plus - no problem in setting up on their network. Call quality is good, speakerphone is loud and works great. My main problem with this phone is battery life. Under normal usage, the battery is dead within 4 hours. I have download the "Battery Dr." app to manage power usage, however I still can't make it through 8 hours without recharging. I may try another battery, have seen hi-capacity batteries here on Amazon and may give one a try. n
heyy friends, you buy this phone, you could tell me where I put the sim card, not appear anywhere. thanks n
This was my first smartphone I have ever purchased. I was almost floored by how awesome it was. Ive played with alot of my friends phones, and they left something to be desired. Plus I got mine for a very cheap price considering the features I got with it. I bought mine used, and i was angry that my camera lens was cracked. But didnt affect the picture quality. Great value for the price. p
This product came to me and I was excited. The first day after activation it was great... After that it was all downhill. The phone kept saying I had to delete all apps in order to send messages. And then, when I did that... It just stopped working all together. This phone was the worst purchase ever made... I'm mad that I can't even return to get my money back. It's sitting on my counter collecting dust. n
Never will I purchase any merchandise from this company again. I ordered the HTC Droid on October 13th, and returned it to Cellphones-4u due to it not staying powered up. Prior to returning to Cellphones-4u, I tried a new battery and even took the phone to a local cell phone store. I was told the phone had a problem with its main system board. Mailed back to Cellphones-4u for refund or replacement as per their request. I never received either a refund or cellphone. Finally called Amazon for assistance. Cellphones-4u told Amazon I agreed to settle - which was a total untruth. I called Cellphones-4u and told them they were fraudulent, and I didn't appreciate their dishonesty. Then, Cellphones-4u told Amazon they never received my phone. I had confirmation of return shipping and receipt numbers. Just received refund today from Amazon, after a lengthy investigation from Amazon. October 13 until December 15th to settle this case. Amazon was great!! The seller receives a zero. n
Its a very good phone and works perfect. I wish that it was plug n play with the pc but you have to install the drivers for it unlike Motorola Droid 2 which is ready on the go. It also lacks the data and battery save feature that the Droid 2 have witch makes me want to go back to my Droid 2. p
I wouldn't recommend giving this phone to a single soul on earth after all the grief it gives me every 5 minutes of the day. At first the phone just shut off once every so often thought its an android phone they have glitches it's just how it is... Wrong it progressed after a month to the battery not working so I replaced the battery once (hoping it'd so.ve my problems) ... And again still the same issues... afer buying a second replacement battery same problems again. The phone continues to shut off at least three times an hour on average maybe even sometimes 5... The phone has very many glitches that require a restart constantly also but mainly it just shuts off. I tried restores, factory resets, and everything else online that should fix my problem. Still no fixes. I can't even hang up a call without taking out the battery it's rediculous. Never buy this phone piece of **** got scammed out of $130 I learned my lesson... Return this phone as soon as possible before the month warranty goes up. The phone most likely was defective and they resold it as is considering its not even in retail packaging. Never again will I up from this seller they lost future sales from me. n
Am very satisfied with this product. With deals like these, why enslave yourself to your carrier for two years? Buy non-contract! p
I wanna too kno I never got my package as for yet y'all told me I would get it aroundd da 8th n
This phone is an Incredible piece of junk. I bought it off Amazon because I had a friend that had purchased usedphones this way but what a mistake. It was a complete waste of $75. I will never purchase a phone this way again.The speaker quit working after a couple of days and the phone only randomly works. I never write reviews aboutproducts but I feel completely ripped off. BEWARE!!!!! n
It more than filled my expectations. I needed a new phone to replace the one I accidentally trashed. Since my contract period was not up for another 8 months I was looking for a phone that would be inexpensive to buy. I found this used one which was in great shape. p
The phone is horrible! It barely texts. The battery dies every day. It was a Christmas present for my son, so we ordered it early. Christmas was after the 30 day return/refund date. I didn't know how bad it actually was until just last week. It was supposed to be an unused phone. n
Thank you for the replacement Droid ; My grandson loved it.. The phone work like it was brand new.....Great product.... p
honestly, ive had my share of bad phones, but this one topped my list... about a week and a half after i bought it, i got anextended battery because the batery life sucked, when i tried to turn my phone on, it got stuck in a reboot loop. now the phone is completly un-usable ! total waste of my money, dont buy it... n
I will never buy a phone from amazon every again I was told this phone is like new with no problemsI can't use it its not like new its a refurbished phone from verizons insurance.company!!! It is broken and doesn't hardly ever work very upset I sent a message to the person I bought it from since I had a 30 day warranty and amazon sent me a message back they were no longer on amazon and not able to recieve.emails ! It's all lies and horrible service!!! NEVER AGAIN n
I bought this phone is August and have had nothing but problems with it. The screen would freeze while I was using it and the phone would also shut down at random times. More recently it wouldn't connect with the charger and now it is completely dead. I don't recommend this phone to anyone. n
bought this phone refurbished and it looks and works like new. Easy to use and works great. my son loves it p
When I order this phone the ad was miss informing both on style or type of phone and price. They are rip off sellers to me. they said phone was 56.99 free shipping .now when trying to return the they say it was 49.99 + shipping. The ad for the phone I bought was miss leading . I wonder how many customers they rip off every day and how much they make off US.!! don't think I will ever order from amazon ever again, the sellers are going to make amazon lose customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! n
This cell phone is a great starter phone for an 11 yr old couldn't ask for anything better. And I have an iPhone but sometimes my daughters phone gets better reception then mine p
as good as new. did not come with memory card and that wasted some time, but I've had it for 14 months and I would say that once a month there's a glitch but that's just like the new one Verizon gave me. p
If we had done proper research we would have known this model was 3g not 4g. Other than that the seller, ManDroid, has been very helpful in correcting the battery issues we've had and actually sent us a free case for the trouble we've had. I would definitely do business with ManDroid again... Thanks Scott! p
The phone started lagging (the screen is possessed!) on the second day!!!It's impossible to do anything without it starting to jump screens, vibrating and openning internet browser every 2-nd minute! n
Soon as I received the phone, it was not working properly at all. The phone was very defective, I couldn't log into any of the software and I had to keep reactivating the phone and it still doesn't work. n
I have had nothing but speedy and very helpful service with the Cellphone Shop and this is a great phone so far... p
This phone arrived timely and was in excellent condition, brand new. I was very happy with the customer service provided by the seller because this phone was for my daughter and I accidentally ordered the wrong phone type to replace my daughter's broken phone.I contacted the seller and they refunded us 100% and sent a return shipment form.This seller is top notch in customer service and the phone was exactly what I ordered. I would recommend it. p
Nice phone. Was afraid it would not be in the shape that it said it would be online. When I opened it, it was in better shape. Easy to use. Had a couple problems with it freezing, but other than that like phone very much. I don't even think I am going to upgrade when I can. Will get phones from amazon again instead of paying cell company prices p
Zero stars, this is the second one that broke right away. This phone stays up all night saying "DROID" OVER AND OVER. n
I got this phone and automatically the camera didn't work, automatically. Phone was in good condition, but I have NO way of downloading apps on it. They used some kind of software that did not include google applications... So no apps except facebook for me. Honestly I paid too much for it and expected more. n
I choose this rating because I do love my new Droid it is fun learning and the thing it do is great. Thank you for having such a great shopping store. p
I really like this phone, my only problem with it would be that the charging port is not very good. The charger does not fit very well because the port on the phone seems to be a little loose. Other than that the phone is great and the shipping was fast!! p
Unit was very solid and I have had no problems with it at all. Has a couple of scratches around the edges but was in very good shape for being used. p
You don't have Google play at all you only have market which is a big waste you can't download up to date apps I would never buy this phone again hate this phone with a Passion DO NOT BUY AT ALL n
It's a good little phone. Smaller than I thought. When I first opened it and activated it the phone had problems. It wouldn't do anything or respond to anything. After I charged it fully and finally got all the updates in it the phone seems to be working great now. No real complaints other than that first day I had it. It's a great phone and really happy with it for the price I paid for it. p
The phone was In okay condition not very good like stated. The whole time I was using it, it shut down 50 times a day on me when ever it wanted to. The seller said they fixed that problem. Very disappointed and waste of my money. n
Easy to use and navigate.Hooks up effortless to home wifi.Phone reception not as good as old Samsung flip phone.Takes great pics. n
I purchased this phone so that I wouldn't have to extend my service contract for another two years. I received it charged it up and transfered service; good to go right? Not so much, the phone wouldn't hold a charge and so I contacted the seller. They sent me out a replacement to the same day; along with a return mailer so that I could send back the orginally at their cost. The new phone came and things were ok but by the end of the second week the second phone was shut off, not holding a charge and freezing up. I contacted the seller once to let them know that I was sending it back and it was not a problem. The problem I had was with the phone only which was no fault of the seller. I would not buy another one of these phones but I would use this seller again without question; their name is Celluar Direct and they are out of Michigan. n
I feel so LUCKY to have found this used (phone to us & not used hard at all), phone on line from someone who upgraded and sold this one. My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again!! p
nice phone, nice up grade from my pantach revue. Very clean set up and easy set up. never had an android phone but they are fantastic to say the least. perfect size for surfing and social media. great phone samsung p
Very pleased p
It works good but it goes slow sometimes but its a very good phone I love it p
Great phone to replace my lost phone. The only thing is the volume up button does not work, but I can still go into settings to adjust. Other than that, it does the job until I am eligible to upgrade my phone again.Thaanks! p
I already had a phone with problems... I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER.... n
The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in. n
Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged, had to buy new battery. Still couldn't stay charged long.so I trashed it.MONEY lost, never again will I buy from this person! !!! n
I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2. p
It's battery life is great. It's very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate. n
My fiance had this phone previously, but caused many problems. So, of course, we decided to browse amazon for a replacement til' our contract is up! & so far so good! n
This is a great product it came after two days of ordering it. There was only one little blemish on the side,but who cares as long as the phone is fullly functional.i recommend this product to anyone reading this. p
These guys are the best! I had a little situation with my item but they quickly fixed the issue. I was pleased and will definitely be buying another phon from them if I need one. p
I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out. n
Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one. Seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. Seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and I had the phone the next day. Phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. Highly recommend this seller p
Had this phone before and loved it but was not working so I got this phone. One thing is the SD card slot does not open up when I try to access it in file managment, even does not show up on the computer. The card is fine was able to open on another phone. Trying to trouble shoot it for now. n
I was able to get the phone I previously owned...with a keyboard and touch screen. It's the best phone and I love it. I still had to clean the device with my service provider, but it was well worth it. p
I brought this phone as a replacement for my daughter, who is very hard on cell phones. I must say it was a great purchase. The phone work wonderful. Thank you p
I love the phone. It does everything I need and works great. I purchased four of these phones through a seller that shipped from Amazon's warehouse. My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card. I couldn't use the camera until I got the card. No problems getting these activated at Sprint. p
unfortunately Sprint could not activate the phone due to the blocking issue with the phone, the matter was handled very well and quickly. Very satisfied with the service. n
The battery was old & had been over used because it barely holds a charge. Otherwise, no issues with the phone itself. p
pros-beautiful screen,capable of running chrome,take good pictures,the keyboard is comfy,fits in my pocket and fit my hands,plays really good videos and gamescons-no Bluetooth,came late,run down fast really quick,doesnt play 1080p videos.but I would still recommend it to those who like to talk and text a lot like me and watch a lot of movies p
I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them. n
Phone good just a little slow phone old but it's a great phone temporary right now. thank you for the great deal p
Phone's speaker little low. Overall very happy with the phone. I would purchase another cell phone from Chubbietech. I am satisfied. p
the phone was great and in good condition. My Daughter is so happy the be a andriod user now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! p
the reasons for the 3 star rating was it was in my opinion better than my iphone 4s but it tends to randomly crash, and randomly power off but it is good for storage space, battery usage, and camera n
Phone works great. No problems at all p
was not in good condition but does work good n
Just... not good. The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop. n
as described, fast ship! p
Perfect in every way. p
One of the phones have a bad charger port. I want to send it back n
Just got this phone and it is a great phone. It's easy to use. p
The phone was great but it had gotten old so it was time for a replacement.it was great while it lasted. p
This phone came in great condition! Great price and it brings back great memories of owning this phone! p
Met all of my expectations. I can't complain at all. Great price! p
Phone is working on, I was planning to use it for whatsapp anyway. The oh problem, I can't change the idiom p
excellent product in perfect condition p

Sharp and classy phone p

Shipped quickly and was exactly what I expected! p
Works wonderful for the price! p
Bought this as an alternative to a smart phone and data plan. I use it with Go-Phone on a pay-as-you-go plan. The phone functions are great. The radio and music players are very good sound quality. The smart phone type features are easier and faster to use than any smart phone I have used. There are some software glitches that are documented on the Nokia support site which proved easily fixed. Even though many of the Nokia based features are no longer supported by Microsoft, you can still use the features needed by accessing the web directly via WIFI connection - or data if you want to pay for the privilege - and launching the site/application from there. Although the new Nokia browser is pretty Spartan in appearance, it is fast and runs with good stability. I am a very big guy with lands large even for my size and I find the full qwerty keyboard to be pretty easy to use. I like the programmable hot keys and on-screen shortcuts. Keeps you from launching items that require data connections by accident. The back lighting is thorough and even and the raised buttons are tactile with a positive click response. The phone does have a few quirks. There is no airplane mode as far as I can tell. The flight profile doesn't seem to be able to be set with the broadcasting and receiving functions turned off. The main navigation button/mouse is a little small and doesn't always respond as expected - that might be me though. All in all I would recommend this phone and vendor highly if you want the features of a smart phone but you don't need GPS or a big data bill every month for a bunch of things you don't need or want to keep you life running smoothly. p
muy buen producto p
This phone is trapped in 2001, if you want a simple phone get an old school flip phone. If you want something also for work get a blackberry or somthing new. This isn't even in the middle of those two, it's in another dimension. Nothing but frustration with this phone. n
Excellent p
A friend mentioned this phone to me and it worth what he said. Thanks a lot my friend. p
Used this unlocked GSM Nokia Asha 302 in the Philippines just recently (Jan-Feb 2015). Excellent, no problem with functionality. Bought a P40 SIM card at the airport & presto! It worked. I passed it on to my brother the instant I came back to the US. He will be visiting the Philippines soon. It was very easy to use. Having been used to smart phones w/ touch screen, I surprised myself when I worked w/ it easily not having read the instructions to operate it. I'll buy another one like this & definitely an upgraded version of this Nokia unlocked GSM phone. p

Excelente p
Nokia is the brand that can be used in telephone, good price, excellent team, was a gift to my daughter and she liked it, easy to use and very affordable price, I recommend it. p
First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found aÂ Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm PlugÂ to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk. p
Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTYDependableTraditional Nokia Menu'sNot Complicated like 'Smart Phones'DurableEasy to use on Straighttalk, Internet, WiFi, Bluetooth. p
This is a solidly-built unlocked phone that is an update to the popular Nokia C3. It runs the S40 software which has its goods and bads. It has good reception and nice audio. The 3g supports 850 and 1900 bands (AT&T and T-mobile when it's hspa is refarmed from 1700/2100 to the 1900 pcs band.) + the 2100 band.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other Nokia qwerty phones (e.g. E5), but comparable to the C3 keyboard. The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad. Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients. Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. OVI store app does not seem to work that well. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time. The battery is fairly good sized (BL-5J). The 'function' keys and the d-pad keys can all be re-assigned to user defined short-cuts. My opinion: it is a worthy update (3g) to the C3, not quite in the same league as the more expensive E5 which has the multi-tasking S60 software. For the price of around $110, it is an unlocked feature (gsm/3g) phone well worth considering, as long as one knows that one is getting a non-smart phone and that apps for S40 is very limited. p
Hola, compramos dos telÃ©fonos y vienieron totalente diferentes, uno vino con la baterÃ­a daÃ±ada, se descarga de inmediato. El otro telÃ©fono vino sin la tarjeta de memoria y los teclados y cargadores son muy distintos.Mi TÃ­a y yo nos sentimos engaÃ±adas y defraudadas :( n
THIS CELLPHONE IS VERY EASY FOR USING, IT HAS COMPLETE APPS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ARE INCORPORATED AND I JUST HAD TO USE IT WITH WI FI CONNECTION, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED IT IS A SIMPLE PHONE BUT COMPLETE AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT... p
GRACIAS ME LLEGO EL PROCTO QUE COMPRE Y LLEVO EN EL MOMENTO INDICADO Y EN UN BUEN ENVALAJE LO RECOMIENDO SASTIFACTORIAMENTE.. p
Freezes alot. But i bought primarily for playing back my music instead of my BB. Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud. The body is strong and neat p
The keys are a little hard to hit, and I didn't expect a Spanish keyboard. But overall, a very good phone. p
Preface: This is not what would be considered a smartphone in the United States (Nothing on the par of Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone), it is basically a feature phone. Also, although it says here that it has a US warranty all of the warranty material it came with referenced Latin American countries so I am not sure if it is really covered under a US Warranty. I returned it during Amazon's return window so it wasn't an issue. Now for the phone review.Pros: The phone has a great keyboard. If you are familiar with the E-series phones its that type of keyboard. The interface is some sort of modified Symbian and I liked it in a lot of ways. The style of the hardware is attractive and the Gray is a nice color. The camera was pretty decent considering it is only 2 megapixels. For e-mail it's adequate.Cons: I'll start with the small issues and work up to the big problem that ultimately made me decide to return the phone. The onboard social network apps are not fully functional. You can update your Facebook or Twitter status but the rest of it is so-so. The Ovi store in general is a poor app store, but this phone isn't able to use many of them. Even the old Facebook app that I used on my old E71 (It used to be called Snaptu but Facebook has since renamed it to Facebook for Everyone) is incompatible with this phone as are most of the better apps in the Ovi store. The browser was mediocre, barely passable. Also, NO GPS for this phone. Nokia/Ovi Maps is incompatible which is too bad because that has always been a Nokia strength. That immediately eliminates this phone as a smart phone. With all of that said, I bought this phone for my wife and she really only needed a phone for texts and calls so we could have overlooked these things. The problem we could not overlook was the very shabby, flimsy piece of metal that was supposed to hold in place the standard sim card. This little piece of metal was barely attached to the phone and would not lock into place to hold down the sim card. Because the sim card would intermittently get lose inside the phone and constantly lose the signal. So we would have to take the battery out and re-adjust the sim card. Then it would work for a little while only to ultimately have to repeat the process. It was WAY more frustration than it was worth. It's too bad because as a basic phone for calls, texts, e-mail, and occasionally updating your Facebook/Twitter status; this phone has a lot of potential. Becuase of the problem with the sim card holder, however, it was essentially unusable. I have used Nokia phones for years (I use a Lumia 710 personally) and I am really surprised Nokia would do such a sloppy job on something as important as the part that holds the sim card in place. What a waste. n
We just received the phone a few days ago. Put in the Consumer Cellular SIM card, and it is ready to go. The phone seems very nice even though we have not come close to discovering all of the things it will do. It has a large number of ring tones built in. p
I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the Nokia C2 I purchased from Amazon in 2012, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone with smartphone features without the touch screen. Red, however, is my favorite color, but I went for the white one because my C2 is silver and I couldn't find a silver Asha 302 on Amazon. I've had it for a week and it works great. Best is the Wi-Fi feature, which gives you access to the Web without purchasing a data plan (which I may have to do if I want to access personal email or go on Facebook). It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features of the C2, which makes it a keeper. And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same Nokia charger I had for the C2. Now all I have to do is await the arrival of my purple phone skin, then I'll be all right. I've had Nokia phones since 1999 and they've never let me down - just get better! p
The Phone is pretty good. I am using it with a LycaMobile plan. Only thing that is awkward is that the bottom row of letters is off compared to other phones and devices. Before this I had been using a blackberry. When trying to type on the nokia I am always mistyping Ms, Ns and espectially the shift key (which you need to hit to insert any punctuation) p
loved everything about it. also it looks like any other touch phone but is not. which makes it stylish yet classic. p
THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED. YOUR PRICE IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT RECEIVE.rECOMMEND IT p
This phone in an excellent phone at a great price. I was impressed with the features of this phone and would recommend this to anyone. p
Have problems setting correct time on Nokia Asha 302. Customer support on Nokia.com does not accept inquiry about Asha 302 phones. Is this product obsolete, or is Nokia customer support poor? Booklet that came with phone is also poorly written. n
This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen. However, it's capable of performing all the basic functions such as calling, messaging, web browsing, social networking and it also has a wi-fi capability. p
I've been a long time user of the iPhone. I finally got sick of it and sold it. I just wanted a simple phone. After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well. The texting interface is very nice and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine. I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles. Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very stable and snappy. You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up. No more iTunes! If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it. p
This phone, like all of Nokia's feature phones, are great for their value and durability. The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a great phone. It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket :P This phone is basically an update of the C-3. It is sleek and small, has a full QWERTY keyboard, and has Wi-Fi internet browsing. This is the best phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.And the buyer should be aware; this is NOT a smartphone. If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed. Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not good for recreational browsing. I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them. I don't know how well they work, but if that's a priority for you this phone probably isn't the best choice. Same goes for the camera; I don't use it, can't speak to its quality, but if a camera is important to you this isn't the best choice.The only other potential negative I can see in this phone is that the keys really are pretty small. I haven't had an issue with them personally, but if someone has big hands I see how this could be annoying.I bought this phone for the advantages to NOT owning a smartphone: longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still good at accomplishing what it needs to. If you're looking for the same thing, Nokia is definitely the best way to go. p
Love it. p
Sorry it took so long to Reply or Review this purchase as it over 18 months.This Phone was a Clone Phone from Hong Kong--The quality is Fair--ALL THE SYMBOLS DON'T MATCH--such as \ ? !--But the phone works I think amazon should Boycott this Seller. n
Bought it as a gift for my Mum and she loves it. It is a strong durable phone, has good reception and it functions well. p

a pretty capable, durable texting phone, unlocked as advertised, but the version i received had arabic on the keys in addition to the typical ISO basic latin and many symbols missing, like "!". n
Excellent phone has all the special functions to be communicated with all social networks, excellent operational...I recommend it 100% excellent product p
Do not buy it!. It feels like a pretended toy in your hand. If you want it for your kids, it's ok!. n
Excellent phone, for adults recommend. . WhatsApp, Internet , app, radio, keyboard qwerty easy for use. Display big visualiser. Funny p
I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update. This Asha 302 phone is just that - all of the Symbian S40 simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware. The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are pretty much good enough, the ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional. The internet and mail stuff is actually useable on T-Mobile's 3.5G network and requires very little data to stay connected on a minumal plan. Strangely, I cannot it do wifi yet ... it receives the signal but just insists on using network data or nothing at all. Probably a setting in the menu I have not toggled to the right setting. Anyway - if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery, a very convenient and useable features, and yet not crack open the crack-pipe of the internet constanly, the Asha 302 does it with style and then some. I may get myself another one or two for the future, as I bet this is the end-run for this type of practical phone. p
when i got phone it wouldn't work I took it to a Verizon store here the battery didn't work even when I charged it for 12 hrs Verizon put another used battery in phone it started to work n
I liked p
Great. Arrived quickly. p
Phone works great, you may have to get a sum card adapter to make micro sim cats work. p
Avianna LLC is an incredible seller. The phone did take a while to get to my place however when the phone didn't work on my provider, Andrew stayed on the phone with me with tech support with my service provider for over 1.5 hrs just to try and get the phone to work. When that didn't work he immediately sent a replacement phone for me to use. He is very receptive to feedback and is constantly in contact when a problem arises. The product was as described, used Sprint Unlocked Blackberry Bold and I believe it is the service from my provider that was the problem. p
Ad advertised as unlocked, had to pay $30..00 to have unlocked, phone number does not appear on phone. n
Exactly what I was expecting.thank you. p
Got it faster than I expected. Just what I needed for my job thanks a lot p
exelente p
phone works great for the price although when we got it by UPS the UPS guy just dropped it between the screen door and our big door p
Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the "cheapest quad-core phone," the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do. p
Is a good product That I recomended it has all you will need, it's fast good looking very good,thank you p
my autistic son is in his glory lol thank you again p
All around good phone, not glitchy at all, or laggy. There are a fee problems such as the storage being very small (only 2gb) and the camera is very poor quality. I'm pretty certain that you can buy a Galaxy S 4 camera and install it to this phone. But all around this is a pretty great phone! p
I have no problem taking the phone to straight talk.The phone came in about 3weeks. The only thing I didn't like was the camera its horrible when trying to get a take picture the pictures wasn't clear p
Delivery was fast. The overall quality of the phone is just like the price very cheap. Not a good quality camera so that is one feature I do not use at all and also not very durable my screen was damaged from a 3 inch drop. However I do suppose you get what you pay for but after only having it for a month I am very willing to just buy a real phone and lose this terrible one. n
Perfect p
Worked OK for awhile now every time I tap the back it shuts off n
Great phone. My sone has been happy with it. Needed to get an extra micro-SD card for more storage. p
Valid for Movilnet in Venezuela, low memory, bad camera, low price, great!! n
very good, excellent p
When I first got the phone it had a very poor camera and one day I hit my phone with a pencil and it turned off immediately. I do not like the phone whatsoever. I would not recommend getting this phone, especially if you like to take a lot of pictures or use a lot of apps. The storage is also very poor. n
Cheap and fast p
The phone works great but my charger outlet on phone is having to be fixed and the one they sent falls out and my phone doesnt charge with it. It will cost 55 dollars to have charger fixed before it messes the motherboard up. Thats almost as much as phone n
very good cell p
very responsible seller and excellent product p
MUY BUENO p
fino fino p
exelentes equipos en lenguaje criollo son una verdaderas naves p
Good p
Its great for the price but I hate how you can not change the lock screen to what you wantAnd just has the default wallpapers for your lockscreen p
When I got new Phone. I loved this phone. but with Android 4.2.2 it very small limited and would not let you set in SD Card where you want it. So may have to upgrade new Android 4.4 I heard they work better. I have not figure out with my. as I using Straight Talk I have no problem setting in Straight Talk APN setting. So Far I want to find better Protection case for this. I have not found what I like. Hopefully they do make one for this phone. p
I like the FM radio feature and charge cradle, but I switched back to a LG 450 flip phone that cost $20 less from best buyReception in weak signal areas not as good as the LG 450. Phone was on T-mobile networkbacklighting uneven on keypad. The number 9 is really bright on my phone.User manual is too small for a phone designed for older people. The manual is about the same size as the phone, so it fits in a small box for shipping. Manual doesn't explain the use of each button in a clear concise way.I couldn't get the alarm to repeat daily. Turning alarm off would cancel alarm for next day. n
I bouht this phone for my 82 year old mother who has macular degeneration, she loves it. It is very easy and she can see the big numbers for dialing and such. p
like your ad...love it! p
the charger did not work. My parents started using the cable directly to the phone n
Have a family member who has ZERO interest in learning anything tech. Years ago gave her an old T-Mobile pre paid flip phone. I had kept it for years as a backup phone. To her it was perfect. She did not want to learn anything else. Problem was the phone and buttons were very small and getting hard for her. Ordered this and put her SIM in it and away it went. She loves it. It will do a lot of extra stuff if she ever decides she wants to learn. For now she loves how much larger the buttons are. Just dead simple to use which is all she wants. p
good quality phone p
does not work well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile closes off some towers to non-T-Mobile phones. n
Screen size is good and easy to read. Sound could be a little louder but is okay. Settings are a little cryptic but get the job done with a few extra key stokes than really needed. I don't care for the way they setup the texting where you have to hit a button twice to get a capital letter then hit it again to turn off capitals. My other brand phone automatically capitalized the first letter after a period but this one does not. Still a good phone though and worth the money. p
This is like the 5th cellphone for my dad in less than a year. My dad always does all type of heavy labour work and in the process he always ends up destroying it in the process. Well my first impressions as i recieved the cellphone in the mail is the keypad. I really like that the numbers are huge and also the display is quite clear and crispy and simple to understand. He had no problem adjusting to this new device.It has a FM radio which does not need headphones to work it has a camera which is OK not the best but plausible. It has an SD slot for media. But it cannot play music nor the videos files they dont show up when i try search the folders in the memory. I like that it has an LED light to alert him of any notifications which is a plus and the ringtones are pretty loud too. Good pick for aging parents. p
This is a really great phone. I am visually impaired and have no problem with it. Will be getting another one for my partner. p
More complicated than I expected. Terrible reception. Too hard for my mom to use. Just frustrates her. n
No internet n
phone reception poor with incoming calls n
Nice phone. Easy to read screen. I am a senior and not a tech so the learning curve was steep. The support at Jethro, however, made it easy. They were knowledgeable, easy to understand, patient, and so willing to help that I would recommend the phone because of them. The SOS button is a good feature and with my limited use as a telephone it is a much less expensive tool than a Life Line.. p
The sleek design and easy of use is what makes this phone really good. The large text is a plus p
My husband loves it!! It is simple to use with large numbers. The simpler the better for him. p
The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it is a little hard for a elder person to use. n
Even the instruction book is better than any I have ever had, but as a senior we need BIG print with the phone, not for your website as page 1 clearly tells us because seniors take instructions with them as we go places, especially traveling and there is not a computer readily at hand, remember we are not the laptop generation, just getting into tablets and they are often to small. Otherwise, so far so GREAT. Love the name, I ask my brother, do you have Jethro, when he is leaving. p
This phone was purchased for my father. I really like the features and for the price it is an excellent deal. It took me exactly 1 month to get everything working on the phone but the issue was not the phone it was me (my first unlocked phone) and Consumer Cellular. The manual that came with the phone is not that good and some things in the manual do not match the phone.I received a lot of help from Jethro. Jeffrey from Jethro is a godsend. He was extremely helpful and always had a cheerful voice. He called me, he sent me pictures, etc. He did whatever it took to help me with my issues even though it was obvious the problem was not on Jethro's end.I really like the phone but the 5 stars are for Jeffrey. I hope Jethro realizes what a great employee they have in him. p
works good for 3G and above. Simple to use. No frills. p
Simple. Sleek. Minimalist. Accepts any Sim. The perfect back-up phone. Nice matte finish. Pretty emerald green notification light. A few cool alarms/ringtones.What could be improved:- Very limited space for messages. Will stop accepting txts after about 30. Even adding an SD card didn't help, so it wasn't programmed to utilize it for messages.- Camera worse than security footage. Why even bother?- Menu structure not intuitive. p
Sounds like you are under water. It shuts off while you are on call. n
I was contacting Jethro customer service, because a couple of keys were sticking. As I was speaking the rep noticed I was breaking up to much, so he told me the phone was a 2G..and most likely did not work well in my area. So he was kind enough to send be a 3.5G phone model SC-628..This one seems to be working fine...so far but I must say it was the best customer service response to solve the issue.... n
[New Edition] Jethro [SC213V2] Flip Quad-band Unlocked GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Emergency Button, 2.4" Large LCD with Large Keypad.A a nice phone, easy to operate and cost friendly. Its also light and so easily portable. You can use your micro sim and save your music and photos. p
everything was great. had a hard time getting the old SIM card to work with it, but Verizon hooked me up p
good phone for my 82 year old dad who wanted a camera, but probably wouldn't be able to deal with an iphone. Needs a memory card for the camera to work though. It's nice you can set speed dials. n
Bought this phone because it was supposedly able to work with Straighttalk or Tracfone. We put a Tracfone SIM card on board, bought a 30 buck Straighttalk minutes card, then discovered it is not compatible with Straighttalk and ther local Wally World wants at least 60 bucks for a SIM card kit that will work--supposedly. My daughter worked with it for about an hour and called every available number. No good. She is expert with today's high tech. The cheaper Tracfone card is available, and I'll ask my daughter to take another try when she has time, but she has her own job and family to take care of. As another point, the only way the manual is of any use at all is to download it as a PDF and print the regular pages. Otherwise, it's +3 readers and a 3 strength magnifying glass. No, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but most particularly not for other elderly people (I'm ready to turn 78). n
Met expectations, easy to use, gave as gift veto elderly relative. She loves it. p
I bought this phone for my 91 year old aunt. It seems very easy for to use. Would certainly recommend it. Purchased another brand senior phone same price that didn't last 2 weeks due to quality of phone screen p
I received my product. p
Good phone for elderly people. p
Bought for my mom! She loves it! p
I searched for unlocked flip phones 3D because my old T-Mobil no longer works in my house.This looks good BUT the only 3D capability is in its second minisim.I NEED SIMPLICITY - I have a husband that can barely ANSWER a flip phone let alone use this and I have NO desire to buy a mini sim.I believe this was badly described. The manual is in bad English and seems to be for a different phone. n
Not as sensitive as our track phone, but the Jethro is easier to read . n
I am very unhappy with the purchase. First of all I paid to have it shipped to me and then once I received it I found out from Staight talk that after 1/1/2017 that it would no longer work with ATT which is the only cell phone carrier that is my area. I was able to send it back but I have to pay the postage. I am not happy. Ken n
I am a computer programmer, but I have to admit that I never made the transition to smartphone, mainly because I sit in from of a computer everyday anyway. If I need access to all those smartphone apps, I just use my laptop! Besides, the screens are tiny and I am farsighted, so that means if I use a smartphone, I am going to have to carry even more items: reading glasses.But I am an adventurous type, biking, motorcycling, hang gliding, scuba, etc. and could find myself in need of assistance during one of these risky adventures. And I do live alone and might need to get help in a car breakdown or a home injury situation. So I bought one of those pre-paid cells and thought, there you go that's problem is solved. No it wasn't. I kept pocket dialing. I couldn't see the screen either. But worse thing was the battery would go dead on me every few days. Since I never used the cell phone except for emergencies, I would always always forget to charge it. So a prepaid didn't work as my emergency phone.Jethro solved the problem. It is a big screen clamshell that is about as inexpensive as a pre-paid, but soooo much more useful. Because it is a clamshell, I get no more pocket dialing. Because it is a big screen, I don't have to carry reading glasses around. I am actually using it a little for taking TODO notes and using the calculator, as well as its great FM radio and flashlight. And its battery lasts more than a week in standby mode! Honestly, I haven't used it yet for a real emergency phone call yet (but I placed several test calls - works great) , but Jethro took my pre-paid T-Mobile SIM with no problems and I was up and running in a few minutes.So if you need a cellphone you can throw in your backpack or glove box in case of emergency, this is it. Plus it is inexpensive, so if you break or lose it, then "No Biggie". p
Fast shipping, and accurate description p
the phone is unable to maintain signal after 2 weeks of usage on the TMobile network. I hope it is a defected product n
Great phone. p
Shortly after return window closed, stopped taking a charge and will not turn on. n
Stopped working after 2 months. Not happy with this phone. n
Defective product. I have placed my T-Mobile SIM card in the phone but it will not read it. I do NOT recommend purchasing this phone. n
sound quality poor, no speaker phone n
Great phone! p
Excelente p
this phone met all our expectations, my dad loved it and is enjoying it! p
This may be an issue of expectation mismatch. For one thing, the phone is much smaller than I expected. Some might think this is a good thing. But for many elderly and hearing aid equipped people, it would work better if the physical dimensions were larger. Secondly, the time to hold the red button for turning the phone off is too short. My 90 year old mother in law often turns the phone off when she is hanging up.That being said, the phone works fine. The buttons and numbers are large. n
I bought it for my elderly grandfather which is very vocal about everything we get him whether we like it or not. He likes the phone it's loud and it's simple. He doesn't need his glasses to use it. I was able to sync it with AT&T p
Just what we needed for an older relative. p
It was a gift for my Grandma in South America and she loved it thanks! p
The speakers are garbage and it only tells time in military time n
I bought this phone for my elderly parent. He has At&t, I did put the SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when the phone calls took place. n
This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find. For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone. I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone. The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse. p
My Granny couldn't use the phone because she wasn't able to use the locking the phone function, and without the lock the phone called people when the phone was in her pocket. If the lock was easier for her, then this phone would be great. n
Not good sound, not easily used by senior, end button is also turn off button...so my elderly mom keeps turning off the phone!Will have to find her another one..,would not purchase this again.The purchase and delivery were as scheduled. n
really surprised by this phone, with fm radio and a flashlight and the SOS feature is nice as well for my mom p
Nice big numbers everywhere! Simple too! p
Ordered phone but it would not work with AT&T. Called company and told it was due to lack of towers. Found that odd since my cell is at&t n
As good as you can hope for in a phone for seniors. Reminiscent of a cordless house phone -- makes it easy to use for an 84-year-old. Buttons light up bright, ringtone volume is adjustable and on max it's more than loud enough for anyone with a hearing problem; though surprisingly the call volume is not adjustable, though it is louder than the previous Verizon flip phone on max volume. I set this up with Cricket service. The phone takes a MINI SIM CARD. Not a micro as someone else has stated. I had to buy another sim card because the micro I ordered was too small. Mini sims are the original, large cards. We live in the US. I don't know people are claiming this phone doesn't work in the US. I paid 30ish for this phone, but would have paid up to 100 for it because of the design and functionality. Side note: I was concerned that my grandmother would always accidentally hit the SOS button this phone has, but it can be disabled in the settings. p
Good p
Thank you p
easy to use. My mother is 78 but she can use it very well. p
Word to the wise: Check with the seller for the type of service this phone does NOT work with if you are technically challenged like I am. I learned something new - "unlocked" is not "unlocked" for all mobile service carriers, like Sprint. It would have been helpful to read that in the product description before purchasing. It seems like a perfect phone for seniors. Apparently I was having a senior moment when I ordered it. n
The SIM card from the provider would not work in this phone, so I am returning the phone. n
Purchased this phone for my parents who have difficulties with the small buttons on other phones. Thanks to the size of the buttons and the display, no more squinting! Also love that the keys are raised. Menu and layout also simple to use. The 5 programmable numbers makes it easy to just call their most frequently used numbers. Ringer volume is good. Would buy it again. p
With a little bit of effort I was able to familiarize myself with this phone, and using it became intuitive. It came with a nice easy to read booklet, and before purchasing it I checked to see if it has a web, site which it does. I inserted the sim card and charged the battery which took a couple of hours. I did have several problems at first, but this was my first cell phone so I didn't have much experience. I mistakenly set the language to Portuguese so I couldn't figure out what to do. Luckily there were several online tutorials at the web site and I restored the phone to the factory setting. Once in English I was able to figure the phone out more easily. One thing I figured out was to use military time as in 2pm equal 1400 when setting the time as there was no am or pm setting. All in all I am happy with the phone. Being hearing impaired I am able to hear the basic ring which is loud. When I put it in my pocket I face the keypad to my leg as the speaker comes out the back and it's even louder. Same thing when I set it on the table I put it face down and the ring is loud and clear. I questioned about using a lanyard and e-mailed the Jethro company. They got right back to me and confirmed that a small hole on the upper left side could accommodate a lanyard by removing the back, feeding the lanyard through the hole and looping it around before replacing the back. The customer service was nice and answered my question in an easy to understand manner. The phone will lock in my pocket so it wont random dial. All I need to do is press the * asterisks until the screen says the phone is unlocked, then I can dial out. The phone always accepts a call without turning it on. This is exactly the simple phone I was looking for. I returned several that did not work. I went with this model so I can use it with Consumer Cellular which is less expensive. For $14.25 (with my AARP discount) I get 4 hours of talk per month. p
Great simple to use phone for my mother. Big buttons, easy to see and use. She has the use of only one arm so the charge cradle is a great benefit. Easy setup, good clarity, gets good signal. p
I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated "senior" phone stopped working. I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that's what it says in Spanish. I set my mom's phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn't need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let's face it, it's the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can't beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it's not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great. The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to "senior" phones, it's slim pickings. This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder. p
Returning product. The volume is absolutely abysmal. Even at maximum it is just audible to me. Bought this for my elderly mother: no way will she be able to hear anything ! For a phone marketed for the elderly this is a disgrace. n
simple to use. Does not seem to get tiem updates from AT&T p
Phone number comes with DAILY SPAM Calls. Really annoying .. The phone is good. n
Perfect, great, inexpensive phone for a senior. Bright, large, backlit numbers, clear controls, large number buttons, light weight, flash light, GSM.For what I paid, about $30, I almost wanted one for myself! Breath of fresh air after smart phones.Good battery life, I really lucked out choosing this and I might buy another one as a backup as my father tends to misplace things.I used it with GIV Mobile - unlimited talk/text and 200mb data for $20/month no contract. p
Good phone for my mom, big numbers, however settings are somewhat confusing. p
Locks accidentally when used. Screen is too small to read text message. NOT easy to use for an elderly person. n
Bought this for my elderly mother. It is pretty nice. It is fairly easy to use. Most importantly, it has large buttons and a fairly large display. It was also easy to add to my AT&T account.A couple of negatives. The SOS button is a nice feature, but is fairly easy to set off. So be prepared for false alarms. Another issue, the phone only displays the time in a 24 hours system. For example, 2:00pm is 14:00. This is extremely confusing for my mother. I bought this phone last Nov. I called Jethro sometime in Dec regarding this and was advised there was a firmware update coming out late Dec / early Jan. I waited until Feb & emailed. Told an update to fix this is time display issue was expected in March and to continue checking back with their support section of their website. I've called & emailed several times regarding this issue and I am told the same thing everytime; a fireware update is coming. It has now been 6 months. Just be advised, the phone only displays time in a 24 hour system. n
I bought this phone for my grandma, it doesn't make or receive calls. I tried a manual selection of the network, and also a factory reset, and nothing happened, she has at&t. n
It's a good phone for emergencies and the numbers are nice and big. Easy to use. Thank You so much p
but did not work with Iwirless p
Does not have Cyrillic! That was a surprize p
We bought the phone for my 92 year old mother who is hearing impaired. She could not hear well on it at all. n
As arrival of this phone and I couldn't charge it its so frustrating n
Looks good, as advertised, instructions not easy to follow. Keys are quite large and fairly easy to see. p
My Dad loves it - works great with no confusing bells and whistles p
Very bad same week i bought could not turn on / offNot worth the hassle don't buy it n
Both of my grandmas love it!!! It could have a bigger screen and more ringtones p
It's just what we were looking for p
Mom doesn't like any kind of change, so it has taken some time and effort to get her to embrace this versus her old flip phone. p
Pros:* The cradle is nice* Lack of camera* Cheaper than snapfonCons:* The reception is terrible. We have t-mobile and all our phones work inside the house except this one. Apparently it's only 2g which is being phased out. So expect reception to get worse over time.* The time/date was not set automatically. Seriously? What year is this?* Unlike every other phone, the buttons directly under the screen are not actually the navigation buttons, they are M1 and M2 which are speed dials. Probably not a problem if this is someone's first phone, but it drove me nuts.* no FCC id! This phone might be illegal to use in the US.* Poor manufacturing quality - the battery is hard to insert and remove because the battery is slightly too big for the part where it's supposed to fit* The voice mail number has to be programmed. Similar to the time/date, every other phone I've ever had picked this setting up from the network automatically.* As other reviews have mentioned, the hangup button, if pressed for longer than about 1 second, the phone powers off. Easy to accidentally do. n
Stopped working after a month of use. n
The placement of the M1 and M2 buttons in particular made this too confusing for my elderly father to use. He tried numerous times to get the phone to turn on to make a simple call and could not get it to work. Now it now longer charges or comes on and he has only had it 6 weeks. Fortunately it didn't cost much but what a waste of money. n
I bought this phone as a simple option for my 84 year old father. I like the big buttons and the charging cradle. The phone feels cheap. I was afraid I'd break the plastic pieces pulling off the cover to get to the battery and SIM card. We I nstalled 3 different SIM cards from Cricket Wireless (AT&T network) at their store and could not get it connected. Don't know for sure if it's something broken on the phone or just an incompatibility. Other reviewers saying they have connected on AT&T leads me to think something is wrong with the phone. This phone is going back. I'm going to try another brand. n
I just not giving 5 stars because I don't know the durability. Everything else are just perfect. I does what it says. Call quality is good. SOS, Speed dial & direct dial works great. Quality of the phone is good. The docking station have some issue but no issue with direct charging, I still rate 4 stars because everything else are just perfect. p
Real nice and simple phone for grandma p
This is basic, but has all the features necessary for seniors. p
returned would not read sim card. n
Great phone for elderly or those not familiar w/ cell phones. Numbers are large,...easier to see. p
not working n
My 79 year old mother, who is partially blind, can easily read the numbers on this phone and that is a great thing! However, this phone only supports 2G and therefore does not work with our AT&T Microcell in our house. Since we have limited cell coverage in our house without the Microcell, this phone does not receive a cell signal a majority of the time. n
Loving it p
I love this simple handset and the limited number of features I can find on it to get myself into trouble. p
This phone is very difficult to unlock. To unlock the phone, you need to press the unlock key 3 times. The first press wakes up the phone, the second press results in a message which says to press the unlock key to unlock. The third press unlocks the phone. There isn't any easier method for unlocking the keyboard without disabling the lock altogether.If you are buying this phone for someone elderly with technology "issues" (as we did), they may have a lot of difficulty using this phone. If the three unlock presses aren't done quick enough, the unlock sequence has to be started again. If the unlock key is pressed 4 times, the phone will be locked again instead of being unlocked. All of this is very difficult to explain to someone with dexterity and technology issues.I have never heard of a phone that is this difficult to unlock. It's hard to believe that there isn't an easier method to unlock the phone. However, I have called customer support and they confirmed that the phone does take 3 unlock presses to unlock the phone. The only alternative is to disable the lock feature.On the plus side, the SOS key does work very well and doesn't require one to unlock the keys. The SOS key can be programmed to send text messages and call 911.Another thing to note is that the title for this phone indicates that there is an extra 20% off today. However, they raised the price by about 10% yesterday to $39.99. So, you aren't saving 20%. I hate when companies raise a price just so they can tell you that you are going to save "more". I paid the $29.99 "black friday" price which was lower than the normal price. n
I wish the ring was louder, but can still be heard ok. I am hard of hearing so like everything louder. It is easy to work, and like that not a lot of buttons that can be pushed accidentally. I might buy for a friend. Am wondering if it is compatible with Verizon.Only one problem with setting up. Book says go to settings, but doesn't tell you how to get to settings. If you go to the left 3 utton key and push, it will say phone book. Just keep pushing down arrow and will lead you to settings. Can unlock the phone and set rings. p
It worked alright, until i qccidetly pushed the silent button (wich was not explained in miserable chinglish user guide.Then it completely stopped my incoming calls,and icound not reset it. n
After reviewing my grandmothers bills I realized she was paying $115 a month for a jitterbug phone with unlimited talk (used 700 minutes a month) & text (never sent one). I bought this phone had AT&T add a no contract line to my plan for $20 a month and gave her this. Works great for her. p
Word to the wise: Check with the seller for the type of service this phone does NOT work with if you are technically challenged like I am. I learned something new - "unlocked" is not "unlocked" for all mobile service carriers, like Sprint. It would have been helpful to read that in the product description before purchasing. It seems like a perfect phone for seniors. Apparently I was having a senior moment when I ordered it. n
The SIM card from the provider would not work in this phone, so I am returning the phone. n
Purchased this phone for my parents who have difficulties with the small buttons on other phones. Thanks to the size of the buttons and the display, no more squinting! Also love that the keys are raised. Menu and layout also simple to use. The 5 programmable numbers makes it easy to just call their most frequently used numbers. Ringer volume is good. Would buy it again. p
Great phone! p
Excelente p
this phone met all our expectations, my dad loved it and is enjoying it! p
This may be an issue of expectation mismatch. For one thing, the phone is much smaller than I expected. Some might think this is a good thing. But for many elderly and hearing aid equipped people, it would work better if the physical dimensions were larger. Secondly, the time to hold the red button for turning the phone off is too short. My 90 year old mother in law often turns the phone off when she is hanging up.That being said, the phone works fine. The buttons and numbers are large. n
I bought it for my elderly grandfather which is very vocal about everything we get him whether we like it or not. He likes the phone it's loud and it's simple. He doesn't need his glasses to use it. I was able to sync it with AT&T p
Just what we needed for an older relative. p
It was a gift for my Grandma in South America and she loved it thanks! p
The speakers are garbage and it only tells time in military time n
I bought this phone for my elderly parent. He has At&t, I did put the SIM card from his At&t phone in the Jethro, it worked. The only Problem he was having was dropped calls. He would receive or make a phone call and the phone would hang up on the person on the other line. I'm asking for a refund. It wasn't his carrier, it's the phone. He had 3 or 4 bars when the phone calls took place. n
This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find. For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone. I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone. The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse. p
the sim card dose not read so what the point selling a tablet /phone that don't work n
This item is not worth the money I paid. cant find where to put memory card. screen isn't clear very blurred, this item sucks n
Good phone p
The tablet really was not I was looking for the sim card did not work the sd card never read ,charger cord broke,I had to purchase another!!I"m really upset with this product...Really surprise me I wanted a tablet that would do all these things and more n
When charging the battery the screen had waves of interference to the point I would not use the tablet while charging. I returned the tablet. n
It is a little more than ok. I use it on Straighttalk unlimited plan as a 3g phone on AT&T 4g SIM. It has a lot of Chinese apps that you can remove. The viewing angles on screen are not the best. However it looks really sharp straight on. Has excellent quality picture and video (Netflix) . Very Poor Camera!!! Texts to all networks that can be reached by AT&T. I have friends on them all. Is a 4.4.2 android kitty Kat so it can use all the Google apps. The voice search is excellent . If it can decipher my worn out gravely southern accent every time. It should work well for you. Great phone for international travel just pop a European SIM in the extra slot and you are in business. If this phablet had a better camera it would be a steal. The battery will last for days if just used for phone. When you surf and use Wi-Fi continuously you will need to recharge more often. It is going to be kept and used p
I AM IN VENEZUELA, THE BATTERY CHARGER IS DAMAGED AND HERE IN VENEZUELA NO WARRANTY THAT BATTERY CHARGER TABLET n
This tablet only worked for 4 months, now it is giving trouble to connect to WiFi so i have no play store access. It sucks n
Really nice, my daughter uses this everyday and its almost been a year and its still going strong...she loves it p
good p
Thank's for best supply!!!! p
Doesn't have Google Play even though picture and description says it does. I contacted E-passion. They were worse than useless. They kept telling me stupid stuff like install Google Play for the non existent app market. It was very obvious they didn't understand much English. n
Very upset The tablet did not work. Sending it back. Will be replacing it. n
Excellent p
great phablet for all general uses p
Is great i love everything about it. n
not liked, because the language is in mandarin or HK also I cannot downland any apps from android stores. n
My friend brought it to me at work after i ordered it on Amazon as we work together overseas and i live in Johannesburg. When i got home and tested the phone the microphone doesnt work. So you can hear but no one can hear you. Now im stuck with it because how would i get ut back to Texas? Very unhappy with the product n

Got this to complete a working scale model office. The little phone actually has a pretty accurate touch screen if I can get my fat fingers to hit only one of those little tiny keys on the keyboard. Probably not bad as a phone for someone with a kid's hands.I can't say that I'm disappointed because I got yellow, and that's what I wanted. But the only color they had in stock was green and I got yellow so drop one star. Also, when I went to put the battery in I discovered THIS PHONE IS NOT RUGGED. The battery cover simply snaps on with no seals to protect against water splashes. So minus another star.All in all its not bad for a $60 smartphone that will not take up much space in the tankbag of your motorbike, or in your hiking bag. But keep it in a zip top bag. If you have a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, (or can VNC into it like I did) it will be a lot easier to set up. n
arrived broken and forgot to send back n
this phone is not worth the money. the plastic is flimsy and the phone hardly works. I am trying to return mine now. don't waste your money. n
I like the size of the phone. Whatever happened to the days when we were supposed to make things smaller? I suppose those days are gone with most people "needing" to watch YouTube videos in 1080p.This phone has the right size to it, but the internal memory has much to be desired. It also doesn't use the micro SD card slot to move apps over to... I know it can probably be rooted to accomodate for this, but why must it be rooted to install more than one app on here? Isn't there an easier way, like an OTA update or something? I'm not that technically savvy... but I would like to install more than one app on here. After all, this is supposed to be a smart phone.Other than those quirks, I like the phone and use it when my daily driver would be intimidated by mother nature. The speaker can be soft at times, but it works for me.If there are any changes to my review, I'll update when I'm able to. n
Is partial internet working,but Indigi is workin on it,hope will be ok n
This is my second sim card I have to use to activated this phone. I contacted the company and still no response. I'm currently doing more research on the matter. To early to rate cause I had this phone for two weeks. n
This little phone is great compact and easy to use love it .Michelleheraud p

This little phone is great compact and easy to use love it .Michelleheraud p
I hate it!!!! I will be sending it back. It keeps blinking on and off. I want my refund back! n
Lots of nice features but touch response slow. Nice looking phone. I only use the phone for one week and I will write review again. Sound volume poor. n
We buy these for work, good price and would be extremely durable for the average person. We do HVAC and we break them a lot not the holster fault. p
They are wonderful. got them for my son as he tends to break them. now we have extras without going through hassle of ordering again!!! thanks for that, that rates 5 stars. p
Does the job but just barely n
lasting longer than the oem p
Crear product. Fast arrived. p
Good thing I had order this 3 pack. Poor quality already burned they 2 cases n
Works great. p
Looks just like the original and I believe it is the original, but a whole lot cheaper. p
these work nice for the price and that is why i bought so many p
I bought these for my father a little over a month ago, and was just able to give them to him today. When he put his phone in the holsters (all 3 of them) the phone wasn't held securely. He still had his original otterbox holster so we compared them. The phone fits snugly into all of the holsters, basically the same as the otterbox, but the piece that holds the phone in place on the replacement holsters allows the phone to slip out when barely bumped. I would've loved to return them, but my window has passed. n
Great p
Great value for some one who uses the Otterbox Defender. p
Great buy & service! p
Work great! p
I bought the 3 pack and am still on the first one. Seems to be working well and hasn't broke. Holds my phone without all of the bulk of a leather flip case. p
not as thick as my old one but it will do! p
I purchased the 3 pack a few weeks back and I just broke the third one today. These are brittle and slightly smaller than they need to be to fit a defender case. My last Otterbox clip lasted over a year before it finally broke. I would not recommend this item. n
Other than clip breaks easily. It's ok for the price. p
Fits as advertised. p
Like a number of other reviewers I break these holsters every 3 months or so. Otterbox is good with their warranty but honestly it is a pain ( I get that - there are a lot of knock-offs). Their main competitor is even worse (no names mentioned). I like the Otterbox and have used them on three phones - all had the same issue with holster breakage. So I decided to give these generic holsters a try. I am one month into using them (and have two back-ups) - so far there have been no issues and they appear to look and work as well as the Otterbox brand at a fraction of the cost. If I break all three I will buy three more - easier and faster to get than replacements from Otterbox (not to even mention their "competitor". If you are willing to take a chance and "go generic" they are a good choice. July 15, 2016 3 1/2 months later - I am still using the first one. It looks like new and works perfectly. I do not treat these gently and am really happy with them thus far. p
Order these every 6 months for my husbands phone. He brakes the clip off theses are A good price and three of them helps keep me from ordering them every other month. They fit his case well and clip to his belt without any problems. p
A++++++++ p
Good product and just as described p
These seem to be the same as the original at a much lower price. p
My husband breaks his otter box belt clip about every 5 to 6 months, so it was great to get this pack of 3. It fit perfect with his otter box. p
Seems to work fine p
Look, feel, and fit like the original, but pressed in *China* instead of *Mexico*. No complaints. p
Clearly a knock-off. First one snapped after 2 weeks, but for a couple of bucks each, not unexpected. n
Anybody with Otterbox knows that the belt clips break frequently. These clips last just as long as the brand name but at a much better price. Fast shipment, too. p
you only got me two belt clip and one not functioner properly. n
The phone is REALLY slow. It doesn't have enough internal memory. It frequently freezes up because it just doesn't have enough memory to handle the apps. It's okay, but if I'd known I'd have so many problems with it, I would have bought a different phone. n
you can download music, applications, comes unlocked, with accessories, well good for that price.Amazin seller! p
Hey those phone won't charge, and what is the insulating film that I have to torn off or on idk before use I don't understand that n
The phone is not powering on I sent it to Jamaica WI and will return once I receive it back n
not good n
Phone is alright, though it did not come with an SD card which you need if you're going to install a few apps p
Good for the price. p
My sim card slide all the way up in the slot. I had to open the phone to retrieve my chip. p
Phone memory is very small, so it works erratically. And no is not working anymore, I do not recommend to buy this phone n
Bought for my son and got connection thru Consumer Cellular as an add on line. Works fine for all included functions and hasn't given any problems yet (~ 1 year so far). I'd buy it again. p
Screen quality is good. Overall, the phone is very slow and has very limited memory. Next to impossible to add additional apps. Instructions are very poor - they seem to have been translated from Chinese into English using a computer translator, so not much of it makes sense in English. Almost no instructions for how to insert the SIM card, except for an illustration which doesn't tell you how to do it so that it doesn't disappear into the phone housing, causing you to have to take the entire phone housing apart to get it back out. For $40, I guess it isn't bad though. n
Very good p
liked the design and the cost was worth it too,I bought this for a family member and so far no complaints p
did not work with at&t network n
1. The main problem with this product is that the only documentation provided is a folded up small piece of paper that is written by someone who does not speak english. So there is no adequate user manual, and it becomes a magical mystery search trying to figure out how to use the phone.2. A second serious hardware problem is that the speaker runs extremely hot, and one cannot place it next to the ear. Must use earphones, or suffer burns.3. Battery life totally sucks.4. Touch screen is exceedingly sensitive, so it registers being touched even if you do not touch it.5. There appears to be nobody in the world that makes a protective case that fits this phone. It would have been smart to make its form factor mathc an iPhone5 or 6, or Samsung, or SOMETHING.6. Other than the above, the phone is OK, and well worth the price. n
Ok phone I buy for someone p
works short battery life p
Good tanks p
It is a nice phone,I buy it to used when I traveled outside the US,I loved it,good smartphone for the price. p
I read the reviews which after the fact I am going to have to say that they were all fake. There were 12 five star reviews when I bought the phone. The phone is absolutely terrible. The security sticker was broken when I got my product, and when I contacted the seller they said that was okay as long as the phone worked. I still haven't been able to use data on the phone and can only use for calls and texts. Also, I'm afraid to out this phone up to my ear. When I did, it burned really hot and radiated heat. It is cheaply made. The touch screen is fickle and unresponsive. It has zero in phone storage, so no apps. Bottom line is that I wished I would have spent a little more money and bought a different phone. n
At first I thought it was not charging but, there was a small plastic strip over the battery that I needed to remove. After I removed it, the phone worked great! p
This phone is horrible. Speaker doesn't work right. Can only have 1 app never again will I buy this phone. I will never recommend it to anyone. The only thing nice about it is that its cheap. If I could give this phone no stars I would... n
Got it so I could test an Android app. It worked well and I had no issues with the software or hardware. The limited memory forced me to buy an SD card to really use it, but it was still worth it for the price I paid. p
My wife loves it, works great and easy to use. p
This phone worked well for phone calls. Very small internal memory could only have one App downloaded. Could not send or recieve MMS . The battery portal broke after only owning for 4 momths. Also had to reset often and wifi very slow. If you are going over seas and just need to make calls it's a good phone but not for everyday use!! n
It is an excellent phono with low cost! p
I received the phone on time, packaged well came with charger and headphones. All a plus however I am rating it a three as the phone feels like a toy phone very light weight , almost feel like it was break just at a 3inch drop, literally. Also the display is hard to read. I bought my oldest two children 2 Verizon pre paid phones for Amazon in October at only 15$ each. Yes only 15$ and they are awesome. This phone was going to be for me however due to the quality im going to give it to my youngest child.If you are looking for a small cheap phone this will work for you though !! :)I do think the phone is overpriced even at 40$ n
Excelent. p
Great as expected p
Wow. So, I'm mourning the loss f my G2X, this is a temporary fix. It's the same size which is nice. It has almost no phone memory so an SD card isn't even an option ( you Need one). The sound if fairly good, functionality is glitchy. It's made in China and prefers to be set up with a google account. Lots of time the scrolling will snag and the screen is unresponsive to the touch. I haven't been ablebto stop the hepatic feedback on the keys when texting\ typing. It can feather and be used as a WiFi hotspot which is good. It's pretty slow loading pages and downloading, I haven't taken any pics yet. It fleshy seem to want to play videos very well but that may be my phone company's hangup. If you're looking at the screen , you need to look straight on, at any angle, you can't see the screen detail. Gettingbthe back off is a struggle too but it's doable. It's plastic, not metal. The white one is white on the back, the face is black. n
I love it very much! p
muy bueno p
My mom loved it until the screen cracked 6 months later just by laying in the purse.. p
I got it, took forever to turn on, has only 300megabytes of internal storage even with a 64gig SD card, and the quality is extremely terrible. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money on junk. n
Horrible horrible phone no reception keeps downloading programs DON'T BUY n
Good p
Much smaller than the photo depicts excellent phone for children or someone who just wants to have phone. not a very good camera at all and display is on the lower side of things but it is a good investment as a first phone due to the fact that it is sturdy and seemingly built strong. Recommended to buy with additional storage card because space is very minimal n
No I didnt I had to by a new phone n
Small phone, isn't compatible with most us services but has nice color and amazing storage. n
It did not work, nevera on. Too bad. n
SLOW, SLOW, SLOW....I'm on my home network and my Nokia 635 has already loaded the weather channel local forecast. This phone is still loading....To restate other reviews: terrible viewing angle, despite adjustments to sensitivity of screen finally on the 55th tap, the screen responded to request....it seems to be hit or miss.....and this phone is just not up to USA phone standards....I'll probably be returning it altho it is a great looking phone !Other than making or receiving calls, this would just pretty much be a paper weight. I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of "you get what you pay for".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!! p
If I could've gave it 0 stars I would have!!!! Awful phone!!! Never by from this seller again!! Phone is not up to USA standards. Maybe good across seas. But not what we're use to. n
It was really bad literally no memory and 2 pages to put stuff on I would not recommend it unless you just wanna call in and out and take good pics n
i mean it works but the screen is horrendous, the viewing angles are absolutely horrible n
I am disappointed with The screen I love purple flowers I don't see I want to return back this phone i don't feel like using it s not same color either n also I am having hard time opening to insert the sim n
phone works fine, would have liked more extensive instructions and so far i can't find a protective cover for it p
Gave the phone as a birthday gift. My friend seems happy with it so far. p
I'm not a fan of touchscreen phones but when my trusted Nokia E71 gave up the ghost, I had to make that transition. This phone meets my needs. Nothing fancy, very nice size - fits perfectly in my palm - and I can finally download "Whatsapp". My siblings and friends have teased me to no end about not having a smartphone to download the app.I'm really not into specs but my husband, who is techy, took a look at the description and confirmed it would be perfect for my needs. I've had it for 4 days now and so far so good. Will update the review if anything changes. And I love the purple color. p
IÂ haveÂ hadÂ theÂ phoneÂ forÂ sevenÂ daysÂ nowÂ andÂ IÂ amÂ impressed.Â ItsÂ setupÂ isÂ veryÂ simple.Â TheÂ screenÂ qualityÂ isÂ great,Â andÂ theÂ processorÂ isÂ fast. p
Â ThisÂ isÂ anÂ extremelyÂ fast,Â good-lookingÂ phoneÂ withÂ excellentÂ storageÂ options,Â greatÂ screenÂ clarity. p
Not recommended. Won't charge after just a few weeks of use. n
No the phone done have Bluetooth on it, which is so bad for my son. n
its a good phone but barely holds any apps.The space is limited n
The phone meet the minimum standard. The network is good but, I can't receive the 3G on my phone to satisfy the desire for purchase n
I never got the thing to turn on. It would take a charge. I had low expectations considering the price, I just wanted to use it as a back up for running credit cards using Square but that isn't going to work out. Returning it. n
I bought this phone for a gift, and when I recieved it, the phone did not work. I had to pay again to return the cellphone from Venezuela to USA. n
It did not work. n
Simple enough with plenty of functions. p
Excelent p
This product is expensive for the quality. At $20 it might be worth it...maybe. You are better off adding a little extra and getting a used second or third generation galaxy or iphone. It will definitely last longer. Regret this purchase. Screen just went south after about 1 week of use. Also the screen quality is not ideal. n
Better than I expected. p
it says T-Mobile compatible; however my sim card once inserted didn't connect at all. it would say sim not connecting to network. great price but I couldn't do nothing more then use the phone when Wi-Fi was avail. no calling out services when away from home. over all the phone was cute. but needed it for me then apps at home. n
Excellent p
very bad n
Good n
Its a cheap phone, but I thought I gave it a try. I guess for what I wanted it, wasn't good. It has very low Internal memory and lots of Ads thrown at you! It also freezes quite a bit. I guess its good if you only want to use it to talk and travel with it because it has a dual sim card slots. n
I didn't like this phone. It is a horrible phone n
very slow i regret buying this i suggest different phones n
Excellent p
The phone is REALLY slow. It doesn't have enough internal memory. It frequently freezes up because it just doesn't have enough memory to handle the apps. It's okay, but if I'd known I'd have so many problems with it, I would have bought a different phone. n
I HATE THIS PHONE, WEEK LATER HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE...ITS SLOW AND STORAGE IS VERY POOR...A WASTE OF MONEY...NEVER AGAIN... n
So bad n
Its good but it's getting heat if I talk more than five minutes n
Piece of crap n
I took this phone all through Mexico with me, and I surfed the web, and made calls (VoIP and regular) and this phone was heroic. The camera isn't bad either. p
bueno p
excelent thank u p
Great phone and easy to use. The price is really good for it. p
The package arrived on time and in good condition. It not covers all my expectations, but is functional for me. n

Phone did not come with a sim card and did not work n
Not the best phone, but made it work temporary. n
Good basic smart phone p
Satisfied with the product. Value for money. p
Was hoping for a decent phone for this price! Was a gift for my niece, every time she used it the phone repeatedly dropped calls! Was an at&t prepaid account was in an area with a strong signal so it wasneeds the carrier. Had to buy another phone!!! n
Wonderful phone it absolutely met all my expectations..i took it to the West Indies and it worked perfectly p
Phone doesn't turn on.Battery is dead.Isn't charging at all.. n
phone did not turn on even after charging phones for hours. Hope this is not a joke n

OK, i'm unboxing this as we speak.1st thing I notice, is no fingernail indentations on the back cover. I cannot remove the back cover, so I can put my SimCard in....The instructions are Literally 1 page, with 1 picture. It shows the inside of the Phone, but it does NOT SHOW how to open the phone.There's no battery in the Box, so I sure hope it's INSIDE the phone already.OK, using a very thin piece of Steel, called a DRILL GAUGE, I was able to pry my way into the cover, without damaging it.The Battery is There, and I see the SimCard Slots. I'm removing the SimCard from my Old Phone (T-Mobile)...You MUST remove the battery, before putting the simcard in. The Sim card will not fit unlesss you do that.I've had the charger hooked up for a full minute, and the phone FINALLY flasshed something on the screen, before it blinked off again.The battery is Unbelievably drained. I doubt the manufacturer even Quality Control Tested it.I assume the Battery's charging, but there's no Indicator Light, letting me know.The battery's been charging for 5 minutes. The only way to get the screen to show me anything is to pop the battery out, wait a few seconds, and put it back in. It's at 1%.... 5 minutes of charging for 1%.... Do the math: It'll take 8 1/2 Hours to reach 100%.OK, Finally got the screen on, "ipromobile.hk" ... I have no idea what country "HK" is... next screen is in chinese, which was NOT SPECIFIED on the Product Description !It says "Bahasa Indonesia" with a Call Button. I select the Triangle (because I can atleast understand "SHAPES")....now something about wifi (i think), I click NEXT (i think), now a User Agreement in Chinese (i think), which i Null & Void if i cant read it, so I will ACCEPT if i can....After a bunch of button clicking and crap, I'm finally on the Phones Desktop-thing. Now I have to learn how to read whatever language this is, and change the damn thing to English...If only there was a Universal Symbol for "LANGUAGE". I mean, you know what the PHONE icon is, you know what the Voice Mail icon is, you know what the Bluetooth symbol... but what is it for LANGUAGE!?!?Seriously, the Language looks like a Cross between Japanese and Chinese... I cant even BEGIN to understand it....BOO YAH ! I got It ! It's in Chinese. I used Google Translate, to find the Characters for "Language":è¯­è¨€ --- Look for these 2 characters, in your phones settings, and Presto, you can select English. It's in a menu that looks like the Letter "A"I'm activating Data Connection, so my SimCard connects to The Network, adding my Google Account, verifying my account, YAY, I'm able to make phone calls.... That's all i need this little sucker to dao anyway....the internal phone storage says "178mb"...You Know, for being a cheap, $40 Piece of Crap, this thing seems to work better than my $600 LG G3. It may not have the CAPABILITIES of the more expensive phone, but this is still a pretty good little phone. Definately a good back-up phone, for when my High-dollar one breaks. n
Works great luv it:)) p
Great Phones Works Perfectly Overseas. Great BuyðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ love this phone p
Excellent..!!!! Thanks. p
I ended up returning this phone. When I put the sim card in it did not stop and went into the phone where I could not reach it. Had to use my tiny screwdrivers to take the phone apart and retrieve the SIM card. This phone also lacks space for apps and updates. n
Great cheap phone. p
fine p
The phone lasted 5 days and went dead never came back on. Will not charge or come on. Horrible phone! n
excelent p
love it p
muy bueno p
My mom loved it until the screen cracked 6 months later just by laying in the purse.. p
I got it, took forever to turn on, has only 300megabytes of internal storage even with a 64gig SD card, and the quality is extremely terrible. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money on junk. n
Horrible horrible phone no reception keeps downloading programs DON'T BUY n
Good p
Much smaller than the photo depicts excellent phone for children or someone who just wants to have phone. not a very good camera at all and display is on the lower side of things but it is a good investment as a first phone due to the fact that it is sturdy and seemingly built strong. Recommended to buy with additional storage card because space is very minimal n
No I didnt I had to by a new phone n
Small phone, isn't compatible with most us services but has nice color and amazing storage. n
It did not work, nevera on. Too bad. n
Don't waste your money. This is the cheapest phone ever! Does not save to SD card for downloads and can only download a few things on internal hard drive. If there were 0 stars I would give left that! n

Great Phone Fast Delivery p
If I could've gave it 0 stars I would have!!!! Awful phone!!! Never by from this seller again!! Phone is not up to USA standards. Maybe good across seas. But not what we're use to. n
It was really bad literally no memory and 2 pages to put stuff on I would not recommend it unless you just wanna call in and out and take good pics n
i mean it works but the screen is horrendous, the viewing angles are absolutely horrible n
I am disappointed with The screen I love purple flowers I don't see I want to return back this phone i don't feel like using it s not same color either n also I am having hard time opening to insert the sim n
phone works fine, would have liked more extensive instructions and so far i can't find a protective cover for it p
Gave the phone as a birthday gift. My friend seems happy with it so far. p
I'm not a fan of touchscreen phones but when my trusted Nokia E71 gave up the ghost, I had to make that transition. This phone meets my needs. Nothing fancy, very nice size - fits perfectly in my palm - and I can finally download "Whatsapp". My siblings and friends have teased me to no end about not having a smartphone to download the app.I'm really not into specs but my husband, who is techy, took a look at the description and confirmed it would be perfect for my needs. I've had it for 4 days now and so far so good. Will update the review if anything changes. And I love the purple color. p

Very good p
liked the design and the cost was worth it too,I bought this for a family member and so far no complaints p
did not work with at&t network n
1. The main problem with this product is that the only documentation provided is a folded up small piece of paper that is written by someone who does not speak english. So there is no adequate user manual, and it becomes a magical mystery search trying to figure out how to use the phone.2. A second serious hardware problem is that the speaker runs extremely hot, and one cannot place it next to the ear. Must use earphones, or suffer burns.3. Battery life totally sucks.4. Touch screen is exceedingly sensitive, so it registers being touched even if you do not touch it.5. There appears to be nobody in the world that makes a protective case that fits this phone. It would have been smart to make its form factor mathc an iPhone5 or 6, or Samsung, or SOMETHING.6. Other than the above, the phone is OK, and well worth the price. n
Ok phone I buy for someone p
works short battery life p
Good tanks p
It is a nice phone,I buy it to used when I traveled outside the US,I loved it,good smartphone for the price. p
I read the reviews which after the fact I am going to have to say that they were all fake. There were 12 five star reviews when I bought the phone. The phone is absolutely terrible. The security sticker was broken when I got my product, and when I contacted the seller they said that was okay as long as the phone worked. I still haven't been able to use data on the phone and can only use for calls and texts. Also, I'm afraid to out this phone up to my ear. When I did, it burned really hot and radiated heat. It is cheaply made. The touch screen is fickle and unresponsive. It has zero in phone storage, so no apps. Bottom line is that I wished I would have spent a little more money and bought a different phone. n
SLOW, SLOW, SLOW....I'm on my home network and my Nokia 635 has already loaded the weather channel local forecast. This phone is still loading....To restate other reviews: terrible viewing angle, despite adjustments to sensitivity of screen finally on the 55th tap, the screen responded to request....it seems to be hit or miss.....and this phone is just not up to USA phone standards....I'll probably be returning it altho it is a great looking phone !Other than making or receiving calls, this would just pretty much be a paper weight. I have to wonder about all the 5 star reviews....They sound mysteriously very similar in their language style and choice of words and phrases which makes me wonder if they are in fact valid. This is a perfect example of "you get what you pay for".....NOT MUCH !!!.UPDATE: August 20, 2015: I am so impressed with the Customer Service of this company ! I received the nicest e mail regarding my comments asking me if there was anything they could do to make my purchase right ! What company actually has personnel in customer service who READS the reviews of purchasers??? Apparently they do ! We have e mailed back and forth and it turns out that they had a newer model that is probably more of what I had in mind for a smart phone and I'm going to buy it. I also suggested that they update the product information on this product that is woefully lacking in tech information. I am told that is in the process of happening also.So I am updating my review to 4 stars because of the fabulous responsive customer service of this company and the fact that this phone may be right for someone who does not have the exact requirements in a phone that I do. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt based on the other reviews, which I was absolutely assured were valid, honest reviews from purchasers. Kudos to Shawyn & this company !!! p
100% recomendado p
I am happy with most of the characteristics of this mobile. except for:1. its wifi connection. For some reason it does not perform well when compared to other devices connected to the same wifi signal2. its 3G is not working well, at least in Argentina. far too slowCamera is great, Processor fast. Do not expect a slim model though! n
The audio does not work!!! n
Im happy with my new phone! Its very fast p

This phone works well as how it supposed to be.It has everything you need to make life easier.Its very easy to use,I can surf the Internet fast,listen to music,take photos and videos and many more.The camera is great for taking photos and videos it's pretty clear and it is dual,front and back camera.The sound quality is not that loud but it's not too low either.However it has a Bluetooth so you can just pair it to any Bluetooth speaker if you want to listen to loud music.This phone is enough for your needs compare to the higher prices phones.It is user friendly with a beautiful LCD display.And the best thing is that it's Unlocked,and can put two sim cards(standard sim & micro sim)great phone when traveling to different country.Its also comes with everything,you don't need to purchase the accessories.It comes with:-USB Cable charger-Wall charger-screen protector-clear flexible rubber case-user manualOverall it's a great phone with great features.Recommended.I'm glad to test this for my honest and unbiased feedback and all opinion is mine and it's based of my experienced on the product. p
Â The phone is an unlocked phone and the support network of the phone is 3G (WCDMA 850/2100) and 2G Quad Band(GSM 850/900/1800/1900) network ,If you have to buy a sim card buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card. Do not buy the CDMA SIM card from them.The support language of the phone is English, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Malaya, Burmese, Cestina, Deutsch, Espanola, French, Italiano, Nederland's, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Turkish, Greek, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Thai, Simplified/Traditional Chinese.If your service support those network, and those language, you can use this phone.It supports two different sims cards and a memory card I put a 64 gig memory card in it and it supported it.The internet on this phone is just as fast as 4g I was very impressed with the speed of the phone and clarity.The phone is very well made and durable you will not be disappointed with this phone.I received this phone at no cost/free to test it and try it out in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the Juning cell phone. p
Cheap-- I am sending it back.. n
I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy s3 and this phone has went above an beyond my expectations. It works the same if not better than my Samsung did for more than half the price. I would def purchase again p
My niece is 15 and so hard on phones, my sister has spent a ton of money replacing phones because at 15 years old the right phone matters. I was given the opportunity to try out the Juning 5" Android phone and passed it along to my niece because I knew it would be perfect for her.Starting with the obvious looks. Just by looks alone, it's amazing. It's Pink and that is something so different than the average phone you can get with a major carrier. It easily resembles a Samsung in size and button placement so she doesn't look "uncool" and the screen is BIG which is important as we all know.The phone easily connected to my homes wifi for set up and I was more than impressed with the speed of it. The quad core is very compatible to my iPhone 6s Plus but without the $750 price tag. It is up to date on android and had many features that my niece was looking for including a front facing camera for those snapchat selfies. There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way. p
This is a good wireless type of phone, the price is really cheap but the quality is good.This phone is already had the latest android system 5.1 lollipop.I don't need lots of specs on a phone, I'm not that tech on the phone.But in my end, I do like most phone work longer, easy to use, work as a friendly user.Anyway, one of the reasons why I have this phone, it's an unlocked phone, this phone can activate on a prepaid wireless network of your choice you can use either the regular sim card or the micro sim. The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

Â 5.0" Phones Unlocked Android 5.1 MTK6580 Quad Core ROM 4GB 5.0MP Camera Dual Sim Quadband-JUNING GSM/3GCellphone Gold I am official a fan of Juning Phone. Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review. p
Just received phone... Phone will not power on or take a charge? n
Battery keeps running down not charging pass 60% n
It was slow, but worked fine. However after only 2 weeks it wouldn't charge. After diagonosis, it was charging port that was defective and could not be repaired. May be just this one i received. I ended up returning the phone. n
It was advertised as being unlocked and compatible with AT&T- It didn't work with my sim card and when I took it into the AT&T store they tried there and weren't able to get it to work either, so I had to return it. Frustrating experience. n
Worst phone I have ever bought haven't had it more then a month or two and it freezes, resets to factory on its own, glitches to black screens, and tries to load pages I haven't even asked it to load, it charges so slow and the battery life sucks horribly, it launches a Justin beiber song randomly that hangs up your phone calls, and won't stay locked, snaps countless pictures and videos randomly in your pocket even while having a password lock on it, I absolutely hate this phone and regret buying two of them, the one I bought my girlfriend didn't work from the moment I bought it, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! n
volume not loud n
I don't know about other phone carriers but this phone does not work with T-Mobile. Calls out and calls coming in work maybe 1/10 times. The signal is terrible. Sad I can't use it when it's such a pretty phone. Will be returning this phone. n
Didn't work when it arrived! So I returned it! What a waste n
OK so far n
This is an amazing phone. I purchased the 6in for myself, and came back a week later, and bought the 5in for a friend. We are both really impressed with this phone. It is super easy to us,e and really sharp looking. I am not interested in paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars for ANY PHONE! This has all of the functions anyone could ever need. I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don't really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are "given the phones in exchange for a review", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have. Thank you Amazon for providing such good products. p
SO FAR I HAVE PHONE ACTIVATED,BUT NOT VERY HAPPY WITH PERFORMANCE,WAITING FOR ANDROID UPGRADE HOPING THAT WILL COMPENSATE ALL THE HEADACHES. n
No 4g with ATT just 2g n
Suburb Mobile works very smooth best android phone I have ever had. Its a stunning design. TheInterface is also easy and functional . comes with lollipop I have no need or interest on rooting because as it comes packs with practical features and appps. You can't go wrong with this just buy it's a solid brand made of high quality material and system too. p
This product is Ã  big peace of sh....ttt!! So i'm warning you!!! Never buy it! Why? Ok let me tell you why!! GPS doesn't Work, the phone burn every time u use it for more than 5 mins and it doesn't Work anymore after 1 month!!Sooo... Don't waste pour money!! I lost but at leaste i can tell everyone that: don't buy chinese stufff!!! Trust great brand!!! n
camera is not that great...but it's a great introductory smartphone for the price. p
Cool phone p
When phones like this is on the market the competition is on, works great runs smooth and you can't brat the price p
It's spectacular. This phone hace a good perfomance. I like it so muchos. It's cheaper the another famous celular but it doesn't shy p
Good phone, good qualty, the only that can better is the camera, on night.. p
I bought this phone for its camera and 64bit and 2 gb ram thought would be blazing fat.Let me tell you this this phone has absolutely the worst camera even when you compare with 5 mgp let alone 13 megapixel it looks so grainy that i hate the phone and will sell it for half price just to get rid of this heavy junk that does not keep up with what they advertise n
the phone is very good for the price, does it right, the wifi has a good reach, the games run fast for a majority, good design, the gps works ok.como I have my bad coverage 4g mobile operator can not prove all rightconsthe sound leaves much to be desired, very badstill no stable version for andoid 5.0 to date,as I have seen are working on it. p

There is plenty of space to download other apps from the Google play store once you get yourself set up too.It is a dual sim phone but my niece doesn't travel out of the country though if that's of importance to you having that extra SIM card port is amazing.**3G (WCDMA 850/2100) 2G Quad Band (GSM 850/900/1800/1900) **That is the specifics as far as what the phone is compatible with. We have T-Mobile and it worked with no issues or lag straight away when we popped her SIM card in. Keep in mind this is at 3G and 2G speeds, it is in no way compatible with 4G or 4G LTE services but as we all know, most companies throttle our data to 2G after just a few gb and I hardly notice at all. I honestly noticed no lag at all in this phone at 3G or 2G speeds.The phones comes with a charger, earbuds, screen protector and a silicone case. I tried a Samsung lightening charger I had around the house but it didn't fast charge the phone. The ear buds are pretty meh.. Nothing amazing and the silicone case is better than nothing. My niece likes it because it is clear and shows off that she has a very unique pink phone. It seems like it provides better protection than none but I'm not sure where to find others since this is kind of a newer brand of phone.Overall, I'd say this is a great phone. It performs great and. For the price, you really can't beat all the kick you get in this Android phone. I'm an iPhone lover but my son is wanting one of these Junings for himself now too and they come in a variety of colors so maybe we will give it another go.I did receive this item for free in exchange for my unbiased review however that did not influence my opinion in any way. p
This is a good wireless type of phone, the price is really cheap but the quality is good.This phone is already had the latest android system 5.1 lollipop.I don't need lots of specs on a phone, I'm not that tech on the phone.But in my end, I do like most phone work longer, easy to use, work as a friendly user.Anyway, one of the reasons why I have this phone, it's an unlocked phone, this phone can activate on a prepaid wireless network of your choice you can use either the regular sim card or the micro sim. The additional advantage is that you can use the phone in any country if you are into travel, this can be a helpful way to avoid roaming charges.Please watch my video.I received this product with a discount in exchanged for an honest and unbiased review.The reseller is not responsible for my opinion.

It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review. p
Just received phone... Phone will not power on or take a charge? n
Battery keeps running down not charging pass 60% n
It was slow, but worked fine. However after only 2 weeks it wouldn't charge. After diagonosis, it was charging port that was defective and could not be repaired. May be just this one i received. I ended up returning the phone. n
It was advertised as being unlocked and compatible with AT&T- It didn't work with my sim card and when I took it into the AT&T store they tried there and weren't able to get it to work either, so I had to return it. Frustrating experience. n
Worst phone I have ever bought haven't had it more then a month or two and it freezes, resets to factory on its own, glitches to black screens, and tries to load pages I haven't even asked it to load, it charges so slow and the battery life sucks horribly, it launches a Justin beiber song randomly that hangs up your phone calls, and won't stay locked, snaps countless pictures and videos randomly in your pocket even while having a password lock on it, I absolutely hate this phone and regret buying two of them, the one I bought my girlfriend didn't work from the moment I bought it, DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! n
volume not loud n
I don't know about other phone carriers but this phone does not work with T-Mobile. Calls out and calls coming in work maybe 1/10 times. The signal is terrible. Sad I can't use it when it's such a pretty phone. Will be returning this phone. n
Didn't work when it arrived! So I returned it! What a waste n
OK so far n
This is an amazing phone. I purchased the 6in for myself, and came back a week later, and bought the 5in for a friend. We are both really impressed with this phone. It is super easy to us,e and really sharp looking. I am not interested in paying hundreds, if not a thousand dollars for ANY PHONE! This has all of the functions anyone could ever need. I highly recommend this phone. The price is amazing, and its free shipping. My only con would be, it is a prime item, and it took 8 days to get to me...from the Midwest. I also don't really like the unverified purchase reviews given from obvious plants. I imagine they are "given the phones in exchange for a review", but are not actual purchases. I think this cheapens the integrity of the seller. This phone is high enough quality that it will speak for itself. The phone earned two, 5 star reviews from us, but the cheesiness of the planted reviews actually gives it a 2-3 star review. I would buy this phone again if something happened to the one I have. Thank you Amazon for providing such good products. p
It was okay but the screen cracked after having it for 1 day n
Â I am so glad technology has evolved so much. From walkie talkie to a smartphone. It's such a huge leap, right? And I'm thankful to all the genius behind the creation of this technology because it has definitely made my life easier. I can still live without a smartphone but life won't ever be the same again.And talking about smartphones, I got the Juning T5 smartphone. It is an unlocked android 5.1 lollipop phone with a 5.5 inch screen size. It has all the features of a regular smartphone camera/video, sound recorder, calendar, clock, music, email, fm radio, flashlight, etc. And for full specifications, here's the linkhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01GYUDMFY/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1This is a very cool phone because of the screen resolution which is very clear. The touch screen response time is very fast too. The camera, video and sound work very well. And since this is already unlocked, you can just choose whatever carrier you want and buy a sim from them and use it on this phone and it will work without issues. Just make sure to buy the GSM/WCDMA SIM card.One of my favorite features of this phone is the smartwake feature. You just have to tap the screen and it will turn the screen on. I also like the fact that the screen size is big enough to see pictures and videos clearly or read texts without difficulty.There are many emerging new smartphones in the market nowadays but Juning smartphones are highly competitive in terms of size, features and especially price.So if you are looking for a trustworthy brand, look at Juning smartphones' direction sold by Qianhai Changying. They have plenty of models to choose from. And this particular model, the Juning T5 has a very good value for the money. It's yours for only $77.99.I got this product for free in exchanged for my honest review. p
Â I am so happy that I got this phone because it carries a lot of cool phone features that i really like. It has 5.5 inches display size which i think is a perfect phone size...It is a half inch bigger than my other phone but yet the weight is just the same and i find it quit good because i still can carry it where ever i go and with the bigger screen size i can totally see every thing clear...I like that it is unlocked and has dual sim card and a memory card slots you can use a regular sim size and a micro sim card i find it very nice because if you go to other country you can just bring this phone and use it right away you just need to get a GSM sim card if your here in the US GSM sim card includes t-mobile, AT&T, cricket, straight talk and sprint how cool is that...This phone's support network's 2G and 3G it does not support 4G which is alright with me...This phone has four available color to choose from there is black, gold, pink and white for you to have. It is up to you what color do you like to get. Plus this phone has a built in wifi, blue tooth, tethering and portable hot spots so no need for us to worry on how to connect to the internet if we are on the go..I was amazed with this phone it does exceeds my expectation especially when i tried using the camera it really amazes me how clear and how nice the pictures are plus the volume of this phone is very good I cannot ask for more I am very happy and so glad that i ordered and got this phone for myself...For under a hundred dollar price this phone is a very good bargain for you guys..So far so good, for now i do not have any complains about this product I will totally recommend this product to my friends and family because this phone is real nice...I received this product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with this company and having this phone for free did not change or affect my thoughts about this product. p
I bought this phone to use on traveling to Africa. It works great. I got a lot of compliments on it. Will buy again. p
I've read the reviews and they are pretty straight forward but this phone may be good on price but the aggravation is greater it freezes and langs to the point it shut off and the speakers are just ruined can't ever understand one word due to the static. Missing parts no charger nor any screen protectors but that not all upper top screen is non responsive . I really didn't think this phone would be a pile of junk VERY DISSAPPOINTED.!!!!? n
So far my son thinks it's a great phone,, p
Â I love the sleek feel and classy design. I have the white color and it is just beautiful. I will definitely have to keep a cover on this though. It is very sensitive to fingerprints. Not a big deal to me, as I generally interchange several covers regularly anyway.What I also like the most of this phone is, it's is dual sim, it means I can use two SIM cards at the same time. Also, the screen is very well responsive and the picture/video quality is excellent! It has a big viewing screen...resolution is great, it's thin, relatively lightweight, very well made, quality construction. Camera is excellent, it's very easy to use. Battery life is good, charges quickly. Overall, it's very nice product for the price and very well made. I would highly recommend this product.Package includes:1x Cellphone1x Battery1x USB Cable1x Charger1x EarphoneI receive this product at discounted price in exchange for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no compensation for this review and I am not required to give a good review. I am also not associated with the seller. p
This phone does not stay charge as well as it just started messing up and i had just ordered it. This is the most issue i ever had out of phone. n
I love this phone if I could buy another one, I would definitely buy it. p
Eye candy, this phone is hand candy. Must see in person to appreciate the beauty of this phone. I love all the phone functioning, the volume button. I love the phone case. I love the design of the phone it's sleek and slim. It fits easily in my purse and comes with a screen protector. It comes with a jelly phone case. It pairs great with my Bluetooth speaker. I love that it connects well with my WiFi. It gives a clean crisp screen every-time. The phone looks like it costs about five hundred dollars but it's affordable. I love the color pink. Its a new brand to me but a great brand if your looking for something high end but at a low price, JUNING is your brand. Its a quality product. I love that the phone gives me freedom to access my facebook page, twitter, instagram, and any other social network I might be signed up to. Most of all gives me the freedom to talk has clear sound, no dropped calls. I got this product free or discounted price to do an unbiased honest review that don't affect how I feel about this product. Love It. p
I am very satisfied with this phone because of the amazing features it offers. With the price of $77.99, you can never go wrong with this phone. It has cool features that's similar to those popular and expensive brand of phones. It's great not having to spend a lot to be satisfied by such product and this Juning 5.5 Android unlocked phone has exceeded my expectation. Pretty impressive!It's almost the same size as the iPhone 6 Plus and it's very slim, so it is not bulky if you want to put this in your pocket. Indeed a pocket-friendly phone. The phone itself is user friendly, which means it is very easy to use and does not contain features that is hard and complicated to use or operate. Simply amazing! It is an unlocked dual sim smart phone, so it is really perfect for us to use any GSM simcard that we want and we can use this phone as back up phone as well whenever we want to travel to another country.One of my favorite features of this phone is the voice search which is very similar to Siri app in iPhones. Very convenient feature! You don't have to type what you want to search just in case you feel lazy and tired. You just press the voice search, say what you want to search and voila! it will automatically give you the results of what you've been searching for.This phone has satisfied me in many ways. For a budget friendly phone like this, there's no regret. I am indeed very happy. Highly recommended!I received this phone for free in exchange for my honest review and opinion. This review is entirely unbiased and is not dependent that I got this item for free. I hope you find my review helpful. p
Â I am so impressed with this T5 model unlocked phone from JUNING. Impressive, why? Getting an android phone for $77.99 is awesome, with all the great features that other expensive phone have and it works great with our wifi connections and also works great while using my GSM sim card. Works smoothly and fast because of the processor unit that is quad core which is the fastest CPU that can be found on expensive smartphones and has an android 5.1 that provides a performance and stability updates, multiple SIM card support, HD voice calling and "Device Protection," which secures lost or stolen devices against factory resets. It has a dual unlocked sim, which is great for a person like me, I have a small business and my business phone number is always separated to my personal number, mostly I will not talk to customers on weekends so that I can spare time with my family. Another thing is, because itâ€™s unlocked, it can be use or compatible to all gsm networks and works great while traveling to different places.Talking about the camera, I am surprisingly amazed even though itâ€™s only has 2.0 MP both front and back but itâ€™s really clear, it seems that it has a 5.0 MP same as my camera before with 5.0 MP. Watching a video and listening to music to it, are totally responsive without any hang ups experience, the audio is totally clear and loud. Last but not the least that I love the most, is the wide touch screen that I didnâ€™t have before, the screen is wide and crisp with a decent resolution and most of all it is slim, thin and lightweight and a slick product, so fast to response with only a soft touch. It is really impressive and very affordable to everyone. Iâ€™ve been using this as my regular phone for a couple of days now and I really love the way it works and the appearance on this phone is very classy and so handy. As you can see on the images below the back cover has rough surface with a good grip to prevent you from dropping it. The package includes: T5 model phone, Battery, USB Cable, Power adapter and earphone. This phone has 4 color options to choose from, Black, gold, pink and white. Indeed, Impressive worth to keep and handle with care. Highly recommended to everyone who's searching a affordable phone that works great. Thank you JUNING for this awesome product. I got this for free/discounted price through a promotional period and this is one of those deals where I am so blessed to get and test the efficiency and assess it for their future buyers. This will make it easier for others to find this review so they may be helped as well. I donâ€™t get anything from it, but I get a good feeling that I helped someone. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. p

Â This phone is pretty neat. For the price, itâ€™s impressive â€“ especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off â€“ there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, Iâ€™m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:â€¢ Affordabilityâ€¢ Functionality (Wifi + Data)â€¢ Can be used on most carriersâ€¢ Huge screenâ€¢ Front and back flashâ€¢ Quad core processorâ€¢ Comes with a screen protector and clear caseâ€¢ Large font optionsCons:â€¢ Lack of cases and accessories for the phoneâ€¢ Camera quality could be improvedâ€¢ Support for 4G would be niceâ€¢ Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review. p
Â 5.5" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. p
Â Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. p
I purchased this phone as a gift and we were very pleased with the packaging and the purchase. It was so easy to set up with a prepaid SIM card and ready to go. The battery lasts almost the entire day, it's beautiful and clear, and even came with a case, screen protector and headphibes. You can't beat that for a brand new Android, for the price. A lot of people confuse it for a high end phone at first glance. Not bad at all. p
worked well for a little while, however phone is unable to send or receive picture messages from the very beginning. what's weirder though is that the phone recieves adds at random, the camera app has adds, sometimes just random adds on the home screen and now that the phone is a week outside the return window it no longer charges at all. an absolute piece of garbage, don't waste your money n
I wrote more positive review for this phone but after having it bit longer. And have buy a second for my daughter both will be getting returned on Monday. The battery randomly drain even if on charger. And no apps running also can't buy replacement battery. Am a regular customer of Amazon generally have very little complaint on products when I but. DON'T waste your money. n
Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting. n
Junk n
Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters... n
I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them. n
Â This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion. p
Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!! p
When I received this phone, I was very Impressed and the color are very cool we never had a color blue phone.Before I give the review I used it and I did try how good it is .

Didnt offer clear and concise instructions on how to put in a sim card. I got bad eyesight so i put in a microsim in the sim slot. Tried to remove it with tweezers now the phone wont power on n
This phone is very good for daily use like calling, texting, social media or net surfing. It's fast and the big 5.5" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected. For the price it's fair and a good size Android phone to have especially if you like YouTube or watch videos online. p
This is a updated review I'm so disappointed I gave this phone to friend in Jamaica I bought it in July and send it to Jamaica in august and the phone isn't working now.. the screen freeze up and no matter what is done it won't come back on.. it's not even 6 months.. how can I contact the vender?? n
The screen gets stuck, and goes black sometimes. It is also slow! n
Â I must say, I'm so impressed with this unlocked cell phone by Juning ! I've never had an unlocked cell phone before and I really needed a new phone. My old one was several years old and not working very well.I was very happy when I opened this phone and saw how big and clear the display is. This unlocked cell phone by Juning comes with the cell phone, battery, phone case, charger, USB cable and an earphone. It also has a thin screen protector on it.The phone itself is slim, lightweight and built well. It is 5.5 " and has both front and back cameras. It is 3G which is fine as we mostly use wifi anyway. The camera is one of my favorite things about this phone. It takes awesome, clear, bright pictures!This cell phone stays charged for a long time even with lots of use. I love that it doesn't have a ton of pre-installed, useless apps on it that you can't uninstall. It also charges from the top instead of the bottom like most phones do which is great of you like to use your phone while it charges.This is a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.I received this unlocked cell phone by Juning for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. This in no way affects how I feel about the product or my review of it. p
Â I am sooo glad that I finally have a new phone! I always have a problem of my old phone because the screen stops working and i had my old phone I think more than 2 years now so ofcourse it already expected that I need a new one. And finally, when I got this Juning 5.5" unlocked cell phones I never hesitate of purchasing this and would love to try this since this is my first time to have a unlocked phone. And when it arrived I was really impressed of how this phone looks so nice. The screen is so big and it is very slim and lightweight. It already has a screen protector and a phone casing. So I am not worried about how to find a phone casing because it is already included plus with a portable headset and a charger. So this is already has complete set. So I used my Verizon phone carrier and see if it does really works and I was totally impressed that it works. I got 3g of my phone which I can use it for wifi only. So far I like it. It works okay. As you can see in my video that I was provided you can see how does it works.And to my over all rating for this one so far this is nice for a reasonable price.I am so glad that I was given an opportunity to review this product for free in exchanged of my honest opinions. p
Â When I got this phone I was so excited. Its very easy to use smartphone at a good ,affordable price. Perform as describe so compared to more expensive BRAND name phones that do the same thing .This phone is the best for the price you cant beat it.This phone is good for travelers because work with all GSM sim card around the world. I travel to my home country quit often and to have an extra phone where I can just drop a sim card is a must. This phone has a nice 5.5 inch screen which is I love and its pretty slim and lightweight. It has a pretty bright high resolution screen and the touch screen is very responsive. Honestly I think this JUNNING X6 has better feature than my S5 the screen are bigger the camera is great its clear like me I love selfie it has a beauty built in, which you can edit your picture right away put makeup on ,blush, eye shadow, eye liner eye lash, lip color ,face foundation .For selfie lover like me this is the phone. Some of the apps like Facebook,playstore,weChat and WhatsApp are already downloaded on the phone.Its really cool and advance smartphone you could ever find it work same thing as the galaxy phone but 1/4 of a price.DISCLEAMER:I receive this product at discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is base on my honest opinion and has nothing to do with the price I paid for the product. p
First thing you need to do on this phone is that set up a Google account to run your play store. It already have pre-installed Facebook, whatsapp, and gmail but you can install also other app that you love. The storage can hold up to 8GB enough space for you to save pictures, videos and games etc.Unfortunately this cellphone is only 3G but you can still use internet, on your phone by your SIM card or wifi works as good as 4G phones. I use sprint SIM card because it is the only phone company works at my area since l live out of town. But you can also use this phone with any other prepaid sim card.All in all this is a decent phone and it works good, affordable and user friendly. Though you can't compare this phone to a high end phone because you can still spot a difference. For the price this is a decent phone. I will recommend this phone.Disclaimer:This phone is provided for free to test and to review. My review is mine alone and it all honest and unbiased. It doesn't affect my review by receiving the product for free. Me myself I also rely on reviews before purchasing products, and I believe honest review is vital to other and to myself as well. I hope this helps. Thank you. p
Â The JUNING phone I got was a 5.5" Dual Sim Phone Unlocked 3G/GSM Android 5.1 Quad Core. Color : GOLDThe functionality of the phone is very similar to any Android phones but this one is very affordable and unlocked.The phone comes with:*Charger (USB-port)*Earphones*User's Manual*Clear phone case*A piece of paper with the note in order to use the battery.(remove the yellow film)*Attached to the screen already,the screen protection/scratch protection (a thin sheet)Like any other phones you got to test the functionality of it and I find it very easy to navigate. It has the default apps that we commonly use, like Facebook, Wechat, Whatsapp, ect. I added Facebook Messenger, Youtube, Google chrome web browser and even added NETFLIX.Camera, which we mostly use to capture the moments and share it to our family and friends. I have no complain, it captures very clearly.Battery wise, I fully charged it the first time and I watched one full movie for like 2 hours and it has still a little half of the battery. I was able to explore some of the features, check emails and do some social networking.But you got to read the label or the note that comes with it because there is a little film that you need to remove in order for you to use the battery.Size and weight: I think it is the perfect size of the screen for me and not heavy at all to carry around. The GOLD color is a plus, it looks so sophisticated and sleek.If you wanna do some screenshots, just press the button volume down and power button together. Because it is 3G you do not expect it to be as fast and quick as 4G.I connected it to my Wi-Fi and and connects pretty well.Over all impression: For this price of an Unlocked android phone is pretty good. If you go overseas and you need a phone that is unlocked and you can just plug in a prepaid sim card, this is a perfect solution and highly recommend this. You don't have to carry your phone that will charge you enormously when you use it overseas.I tried my T-Mobile sim and it works well.Got this phone in a discounted price for an honest review based on my experience while using it. And to help others who are looking for affordable and unlocked phones that works like any android phones that are expensive. p
I bought this phone to give as a gift to a friend, she called me today to informed that the phone is not working and she was not able to use it at all. Is there a way to exchange it? n
I purchased 2 of this phone, they were delivered in October 6 . I didn't not use them right away, I charged them. October 31 I turned them on, one of the phone works the other one showing a green robot on the screen. I sent an email to the vendor on 11/1/2016 to see if there is something I should do. He hasn't got back to me yet. Here is the screen picture photo n
The item was not working at all n
Does not work at all. Let the seller checked averting on the phone before shopping it to you. n
this phone is no good its slow , it freezes every second you cant do anything on it its a waist of my money and i would not recomend anyone to buy it and the reviews they give on it is a lie dont buy this phone its no good it only looks good. n
Lousy phone, speakers didn't work n
Bought it, turned it on, did not work. Opened up the back, made sure it was in right, still did not work. It was supposed to be new, but i it was used. Found scratches on cover. n
Didnt offer clear and concise instructions on how to put in a sim card. I got bad eyesight so i put in a microsim in the sim slot. Tried to remove it with tweezers now the phone wont power on n
This phone is very good for daily use like calling, texting, social media or net surfing. It's fast and the big 5.5" inch screen is making things on the screen bigger and easy to read. I've been using this mainly for watching Youtube. My son loves using this as the screen is way bigger as compared to my iPhone 5C.This also came with a screen protector and a clear case that's a little gray in color. It is a dual sim card phone and you can also put an SD card inside the phone if you want to expand the memory.The only downside of this phone is the lack of internal space memory. I can't freely download anything I want into this phone because there's not enough space and right now I don't have a spare SD card to use for this phone. I really wish that for a nice phone like this, they should just make this an 8GB memory space rather than 4GB.Over all, this phone works as expected.

A few issues but the main one is: Poor signal reception. Looses signal where other phones on same network has signal. n
really is so bad after pay conection fee this cel the charge part not work don't let me charge the phone and I buy 3 diferent charge and still don't worked n
Worst phone ever... not only you canâ€™t find a case but if it falls once it will crack and you wonâ€™t be able to use it. I tried to sell it on one of those machines at Walmart and it wonâ€™t even recognize the device. DO NOT BUY!!! n
Phone is cheap...only had it for 3-5 months n it already stopped working. Could download anything because the memory sucked. Don't waste your time and money on this phone. n
Don t like it n

I purchased this phone as a gift and we were very pleased with the packaging and the purchase. It was so easy to set up with a prepaid SIM card and ready to go. The battery lasts almost the entire day, it's beautiful and clear, and even came with a case, screen protector and headphibes. You can't beat that for a brand new Android, for the price. A lot of people confuse it for a high end phone at first glance. Not bad at all. p
worked well for a little while, however phone is unable to send or receive picture messages from the very beginning. what's weirder though is that the phone recieves adds at random, the camera app has adds, sometimes just random adds on the home screen and now that the phone is a week outside the return window it no longer charges at all. an absolute piece of garbage, don't waste your money n
I wrote more positive review for this phone but after having it bit longer. And have buy a second for my daughter both will be getting returned on Monday. The battery randomly drain even if on charger. And no apps running also can't buy replacement battery. Am a regular customer of Amazon generally have very little complaint on products when I but. DON'T waste your money. n
Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting. n
Junk n
Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters... n
I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them. n
Â This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion. p
Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!! p
When I received this phone, I was very Impressed and the color are very cool we never had a color blue phone.Before I give the review I used it and I did try how good it is . For my own experience this phone it has a very bright and clear display and I really like thin frame ,light weight easy to hold very good quality super love love it..*** Lets talk about making a call ***This phone Has a very clear high quality sound when making and receiving calls I love to use it.

Â This phone is pretty neat. For the price, itâ€™s impressive â€“ especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off â€“ there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, Iâ€™m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:â€¢ Affordabilityâ€¢ Functionality (Wifi + Data)â€¢ Can be used on most carriersâ€¢ Huge screenâ€¢ Front and back flashâ€¢ Quad core processorâ€¢ Comes with a screen protector and clear caseâ€¢ Large font optionsCons:â€¢ Lack of cases and accessories for the phoneâ€¢ Camera quality could be improvedâ€¢ Support for 4G would be niceâ€¢ Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review. p
Â 5.5" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. p
Â Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. p

Bought it, turned it on, did not work. Opened up the back, made sure it was in right, still did not work. It was supposed to be new, but i it was used. Found scratches on cover. n
I wish i could give it 0 or negative stars. Based on the high ratings from other customers, this was purchased for my mother. When she received it, the charging cable was too loose and the device would NOT accept a charge. She even tried 3 or 4 other charging cables, none of them worked on this device. In addition, when she tried to insert her SIM card (from old phone), the card fell into the slot and she had to fish it out with a needle. This task took a long time to finish. The other customers may have just gotten really lucky with their purchases--we did not. SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. n
I returned it...don't bother..u can make calls and text but forget about using your carriers internet/data outside of Wi-Fi. Its really cute though. n
Phone was too slow. Had a defect. n
Â Android Lollipop on a budget. This phone is great. It keeps the pre-installed apps at a minimum but gives you what you need at the same time. I won't list all of the specs of the phone here as you can see them on the product page. But I will tell you that this is a nice looking phone, it has smooth features and doesn't feel cheap. The camera is awesome, front and rear facing cameras too. The screen on this is clear and responsive to touch. I have owned many phones and this has the functionality of the higher end phones without the price tag. This is actually less expensive than most deductibles on phone insurance policies and then they give you a refurbished phone anyway. Checkout the pictures and video for more details on the user experience. The image of the two phones show the Juning (white) next to an iPhone 5 (black) for comparison.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. p
Â So i got this Juning phone 3 days ago, and i started using it already, and i have no complains about this phone. Everything works well, i downloaded music as well and the built in speaker is super clear. As you can see it or hear on my video. You be the judge. Not just that, the apps works perfectly fine. And also before i forget, one thing that i ,ove about thins phone also is that it has BUILT in TORCH flashlight app already which we can use if or when there's a block out on a certain place that needs light.The quality of this JUNING phone is great i could not ask for more. Everything that i wrote and you've seen in the video is all true. Everything i say on my review is based on my personal experience for days that i have been using this juning phone. And lastly i will personally recommend this product to my family and friends. Its user friendly very easy to operate and Its really a great phone and its worth of your money as well too.I got this phone for free in return only of my honest and unbiased review of this product, I am writing what I experienced and only based of my experience, while using the JUNING PHONE. I would just like to thank sophie also, you are one of kind. p
This phone arrived dead n
Good phone but easy to break screen.This thing is also full of ads.Which Burns up your data plan.I wish there was a way to kill the ads.I think it is part of the interface.I had to reset it about every Two weeks.The ads eat up your memory on your phone to.Nice phone just to many flaws in it. n
I bought this phone " 5.5"unlocked GSM phone" and shipped to Africa , but this phone never work...I waisted my money n
Phone would not turn on after charge all night n
I needed to replace my cellphone. My cellphone that I have had for 3 years wasn't a smart phone, just regular. I looked around and studied and found this was the best low priced unlocked smart phone. I can use it on WiFi to play games and browse. I use the cellphone strictly for calls and texts. I haven't tried it for texting, but I find it works wonderfully for calls. I had to re-learn how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS. I guess it is the .5 G of RAM that limits how fast it goes. I am satisfied with it however, and bring a lithium battery pack along to plug into the smartphone when the battery gets low and I want to play games or browse. p
The phone was just overall horrible n
Wow!!!ðŸ˜±It the best phone ever. I got a case and a screen protector and my games show clear along with a nice camera but it will be best to take a picture outside so u can see it betterðŸ˜Š p
The product delivery was fast. I received it 4 days after ordering. Don't be disappointed if the product is slow. For the money its worth and the brand, its not gonna be like a real galaxy or iPhone. The gps is having locating where you are and directions doesnt work. The apps takes a while to load. If you just want basic phone to call in and out and take pictures this phone is good for that. n
worked 2 days and died n
This is not a good devise I do not recommend it to any one it just waste your money . I bought last week when I got it I found out it did not work . It is not unlocked . No no no . It is locked . n
Phone was too slow. Had a defect. n
Â Android Lollipop on a budget. This phone is great. It keeps the pre-installed apps at a minimum but gives you what you need at the same time. I won't list all of the specs of the phone here as you can see them on the product page. But I will tell you that this is a nice looking phone, it has smooth features and doesn't feel cheap. The camera is awesome, front and rear facing cameras too. The screen on this is clear and responsive to touch. I have owned many phones and this has the functionality of the higher end phones without the price tag. This is actually less expensive than most deductibles on phone insurance policies and then they give you a refurbished phone anyway. Checkout the pictures and video for more details on the user experience. The image of the two phones show the Juning (white) next to an iPhone 5 (black) for comparison.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. p
Â So i got this Juning phone 3 days ago, and i started using it already, and i have no complains about this phone. Everything works well, i downloaded music as well and the built in speaker is super clear. As you can see it or hear on my video. You be the judge. Not just that, the apps works perfectly fine. And also before i forget, one thing that i ,ove about thins phone also is that it has BUILT in TORCH flashlight app already which we can use if or when there's a block out on a certain place that needs light.The quality of this JUNING phone is great i could not ask for more. Everything that i wrote and you've seen in the video is all true. Everything i say on my review is based on my personal experience for days that i have been using this juning phone. And lastly i will personally recommend this product to my family and friends. Its user friendly very easy to operate and Its really a great phone and its worth of your money as well too.I got this phone for free in return only of my honest and unbiased review of this product, I am writing what I experienced and only based of my experience, while using the JUNING PHONE. I would just like to thank sophie also, you are one of kind. p
This phone arrived dead n
Good phone but easy to break screen.This thing is also full of ads.Which Burns up your data plan.I wish there was a way to kill the ads.I think it is part of the interface.I had to reset it about every Two weeks.The ads eat up your memory on your phone to.Nice phone just to many flaws in it. n
I bought this phone " 5.5"unlocked GSM phone" and shipped to Africa , but this phone never work...I waisted my money n
Phone would not turn on after charge all night n
I needed to replace my cellphone. My cellphone that I have had for 3 years wasn't a smart phone, just regular. I looked around and studied and found this was the best low priced unlocked smart phone. I can use it on WiFi to play games and browse. I use the cellphone strictly for calls and texts. I haven't tried it for texting, but I find it works wonderfully for calls. I had to re-learn how to make and receive calls, since this is the first time I have used a smart phone. I have an android tablet that I enjoy so I find this android smartphone to be handy to take with me if I want to browse on WiFi when I am away from home. I used to take the tablet and the cellphone with me when I went out. Now they are combined in one unit. This android cellphone/tablet is slow for a quad-core OS. I guess it is the .5 G of RAM that limits how fast it goes. I am satisfied with it however, and bring a lithium battery pack along to plug into the smartphone when the battery gets low and I want to play games or browse. p

Â This phone is pretty neat. For the price, itâ€™s impressive â€“ especially because it is unlocked and can be used with any carrier that has a large SIM card. This phone does not support 4G LTE internet, but does support 3G. This only means that the internet is a tad slower than some other phones that support 4G. It operates much like other android/google phones that I have come into contact with. It features a quad core processor, 1GB RAM, a 2.0 megapixel front camera and 5.0 megapixel back camera. It also includes dual flash, one on the front and one on the back which is pretty impressive. Wifi is enabled and it can be run off the wifi at home if there is no SIM card currently available. The back of the phone is very flexible but thin so be careful taking the back off â€“ there is a small piece of tape over the battery connector to make sure the battery is charged before use. There are currently no cases available for the phone so be careful when handling it, overall, Iâ€™m very happy with the phone. It does everything that I need it to do and is an affordable alternative to shopping at the store (where its more expensive). It supports many apps, its a mobile hotspot, Youtube, Facebook, emails, messaging, Bluetooth, music, and more!Pros:â€¢ Affordabilityâ€¢ Functionality (Wifi + Data)â€¢ Can be used on most carriersâ€¢ Huge screenâ€¢ Front and back flashâ€¢ Quad core processorâ€¢ Comes with a screen protector and clear caseâ€¢ Large font optionsCons:â€¢ Lack of cases and accessories for the phoneâ€¢ Camera quality could be improvedâ€¢ Support for 4G would be niceâ€¢ Very slight sound distortion when using speakers all the way up for musicI would definitely repurchase this, it is perfect for my mother who uses her phone at work and to message on Facebook.I received this item for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased, and authentic review. I have thoroughly tested any product I review - I take pride in informing potential customers about the perks and flaws of products. I have no affiliation with the seller and am not obligated to leave a positive review. p
Â 5.5" Phone Unlocked Dual Sim Quad Core-JUNING Android 5.1 Cellphone Blue arrived in good condition and good packaging.I am so excited to finally receive this cell phone, it will be a gift for my nephew back home. Once I received it, I immediately began to charge it and was able to start the phone successfully. The operating system works perfectly and all the necessary updates make for fast and smooth operation. The camera is very powerful and produces excellent pictures. The built in microphone is very good and records audio very clearly. The video record and playback function is seamless and smooth. I also like the size of the phone and it has a good solid feel and weight. This cell phone came with a screen protector already installed and additional screen protectors in the package. This cell phone is very easy to use. I especially like having a dual sim option so that I can have a my work phone number be separate from personal number. This phone is very affordable and looks great!I love this cell phone and would absolutely recommend it to anyone.I received this cell phone at a reduced or discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. p
Â Phone looks very nice, with a note equivilent hd screen. The OS is android 5.1, I am unsure if android 6.x is supported. Device has a light duty, slightly flimsy case, you will need to be careful taking it on and off as you could crack it while doing so. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied so all you have to do is take the plastic bit off of the front and the screen protector is good to go. All of the software on the phone works fine, it has wifi, bluetooth, and sim signal. It has spots for 2 sim cards and 1 sd card, which will be great as an international phone if you plan on going out of the country. cameras both work fine, not super high MP but nothing to be worried about if a phone is your main camera. The phone is fast and I haven't had any trouble running basic apps over wifi like web browsers of facebook app. Basic games seem to work fine as well and run without a hitch. No downside that I can see outside of not being 4g/lte capable. Great phone for the price. Would love to get another one from same seller for my mother.I have received the item at a discounted price in exchange of my honest and unbiased review. p
I purchased this phone as a gift and we were very pleased with the packaging and the purchase. It was so easy to set up with a prepaid SIM card and ready to go. The battery lasts almost the entire day, it's beautiful and clear, and even came with a case, screen protector and headphibes. You can't beat that for a brand new Android, for the price. A lot of people confuse it for a high end phone at first glance. Not bad at all. p
worked well for a little while, however phone is unable to send or receive picture messages from the very beginning. what's weirder though is that the phone recieves adds at random, the camera app has adds, sometimes just random adds on the home screen and now that the phone is a week outside the return window it no longer charges at all. an absolute piece of garbage, don't waste your money n
I wrote more positive review for this phone but after having it bit longer. And have buy a second for my daughter both will be getting returned on Monday. The battery randomly drain even if on charger. And no apps running also can't buy replacement battery. Am a regular customer of Amazon generally have very little complaint on products when I but. DON'T waste your money. n
Not happy with this phone. Not able to get but 1 gh on this phone. I have been with T-Mobile for 5 years and been very satisfied with their service. Because this phone is foreign, neither TMobile or ATT were able to get a faster internet. It is very slow and very often says it cant open the page and says retry. Also, the screen of the phone began cracking within a week of having it. This phone is only good for making phone calls and texting. n
Junk n
Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters... n
I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them. n
Â This phone is a very pretty looking phone. It offers a slim profile however still great battery length. The quality is great. I was really satisfied with both the video and sound the phone offers. I have to say the color of the phone is one of my favorite features. It's not a tacky gold color. It don't appear cheap. It's actually more of a flat yet metallic look. The phone is very comfortable to hold and definitely isn't heavy. The battery, sim card slot, and SD slot are very easy to access and use. For me, this is very beneficial as I have to swap batteries often since I have to be on mobile web many hours a day. I often have to store photos and files on the SD cards for work. I also flip my sim cards between phones for work as well. This phone made things more convenient for me. The next favorite feature is the hot spot and tethering. I tether often with work and home life. I live in a town where the internet is very slow, and when I turn my tethering on, I can accomplish all my tasks faster than if I had just used my home wifi. The phone comes preloaded with both apps and quick load tabs. If your a busy person on the run like I am, these features are lifesavers. I often have to swap back and forth between four apps, and use many internet pages all day long. The fast tabs stop you from typing in URLs incorrectly. This phone helps me in both my personal and work life. The phone holds signal better than the prepaid phone I use. The battery life seems to last longer as well. I really enjoy this phone. I've enclosed a video to see the features of the phone. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone for free or at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion. p
Let me begin by saying that this is a wonderful cellphone. I was just impressed with all the quality, features and capabilities that it has. It's very comparable to leading Smartphones and IOS in the market today but at a reasonable price. When i opened the box, it contained all the accessories i need for the cellphone, you name it USB charger, manual, battery pack, headphones and also has extra case and screen protector that normally won't be included when you buy other cellphones. I love that it has dual camera, 2MP on the front and 5MP on back. This smartphone has all the features you would want like camera, messaging, bluetooth capability, WIFI, clock, calculator, wallpapers, calendar, email, GPS, FM, 3G and most of all can download tons of apps in the Play Store. I got the white color and just loves it, very light and thin, it downloads apps quickly, has very responsive touchscreen as well. I received this Smartphone at discount for an honest and unbiased review. All my reviews are completely my own and are based on my overall personal experience using the product. I leave reviews to help other customers make good buying decisions. I definitely would recommend this cellphone. What an excellent buy for what you get all in the package, plus it's unlocked so you can use it with any GSM providers. Not to mention it also has dual sim card slot and with great coverage. I'm very pleased with my new cellphone. It's definitely an Awesome buy!!! p
When I received this phone, I was very Impressed and the color are very cool we never had a color blue phone.Before I give the review I used it and I did try how good it is .

good p
Excellent seller recommend 100% p
Decent price for a decent piece of equipment. The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price. n
perfect p
the best phone you can buy for this price I love it p
exelente p
excellent product. p
very good p
Excellent phone for the price, dual sim, unlocked, with Google Play store. I even got CWM custom recovery to install on it and now I can experiment with other firmware. Please note that most of the CWM installation instruction will NOT work because they were written for the wrong version of the phone. This is the so called å‘å“¥ç‰ˆ, you would need to know a bit of Chinese and find the right CWM image for it.The resolution is of course on the low side for such a big phone. On the other hand, I purchased it for my mother and configured it with huge fonts in any case, so it didn't bother me. p
Excellent phone functions recommend p
I'm so surprise about this phone...great quality! In cheap price!!!!happy happy the only cons is the long wait to be shipped.but its worth! p
gracias p
This product shut down the screen when u use to audio/video call in skype,viber,& messenger! The screen will turn back on only when u remove the battery and turn on again! Factory deffect! n
The camara sucks n
The screen color quality is crisp as most leading brands. The volume is loud in ear & the speakerphone as well ( I like ) The only thing I dislike is all the China Apps installed. I've disabled most & there are a few things that still have the chinese language, however, considering the processing speed, screen clarity, & price, I'm keeping it :) p
quality team recommend them to everyone on amazon. p
Very nice.arrived on time. I love it. p
Excellent! p
the product is good but the English language still have settings showing in Chinese and its does not have google play.is there any change you provide more details on how I can get full version to download in English that I can install in the phones? n

It's Ok! I went back to my old phone because so much was not working right on this phone and I haven't had time to call to see if it was a phone problem or phone carrier problem. I could call and receive calls, and text and receive texts, but none of the data would work, it wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't view anything nor download anything. I got an error with everything I tried. So I put my SIM card back in my old phone for now. When I have the chance, I'll try to see what's wrong with this phone because it seems like a really nice phone, and I love the size of the screen. n
THANK YOU SO MUCH! ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION p
Good afternoon is to inform the team 5.5-Inch Lenovo A850 Unlocked 3G has the following fails, the computer does not recognize any SIM card into its two slots, I wonder if the team is still in warranty and see what we can do no more than say thank you very much. p
the phone can be put in Spanish ? n
Came with only Chinese instructions. Defective and would not charge for many days. Had to return to Amazon. n
Exelente p
I sent the phone to Colombia, and They had to change the battery because the one the phone came with, did not work. They had to pay almost $50 to replace it.The phone is working as expected after that. n
I received it, charged the battery and nothing happened. The photo was DOA. Nada. Returned and got my money back to buy another brand. n
Genial cell phone, fast and beautiful. The camera is us their main attraction. p

Charge port went bad within a few months n
Didn't have the color that originally wanted when the product shipped out. The white one seem to have ran out of stock just as I ordered it a week ago. Got a knock off version instead. I was expecting the original Lenovo phone however, as a gift to my baby sister she enjoyed the cute features. n
sometimes the screen and home button are unresponsive to the touch, maybe i got the defective one, but i do like lenovo brand. n
I did not like the phone worked only 03 days , it turns on and off alone without emitting any action on my part. Do not waste your money on this option n
Nice phone. Android gsm with 2sims great. p
Defective. Bought as Christmas gift. Recipient said it's not working. Earpiece is also missing from the box. n
the phone it is terrible ,got some pornovirus,and kepeeng come back on the phone screen and it does not let you do anything,waste off money and i have this for only 3 months n
The phone is perfect but I did not receive headphones p

Love it, your the best LENOVO. p
Excellent product !! p
Just received this phone and I'm very impressed with the quality. I've had a Lenovo computer and it was a great device. The phone thus far seems so too. I recently purchased a POSH 5.7 phone that was horrible. Very sluggish and froze. This phone however is very fast is comparison. The phone I was trying to replace with these recent purchases was the Samsung G 3. It was a great phone but after two years and many falls needed to be replaced. This Lenovo feels and looks of the same quality, unlike the POSH. I highly recommend it! I will keep this updated if I encounter any problems. p
very good p
As described p
my husband love this phone a lot..style & performance superb... p
yes p

So far , so good . Works well p

It came without the headphones. And in the box and publication says q is included n
Good p
feliz exelente p
unfortunately phone did not open. so it dosen work. the seller dont care it. i think when rooted malfunctioned. dont get. i get 2 one . one of them is trush. n
I am still getting used to it. It is unlocked but It was not rooted. It is subject to annoying "GSM Buzz" near my radio/TV/speakers. I like the dual SIM slots. I use one plan for voice and another for data/text. Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap. So buy your own ear buds. n
Okey p
It's very very good buy it p
Bad cell phone n
excelent seller and product p
dynamic isn't working n
Not a great phone but good value for money p
Just as promised. This a great SmartPhone. Very fast interface. Just make sure you buy it "Rooted" and google Play pre-Installed. Awesome. Can't get enough of it. p
Great Product p
Great product! p
this phone has poor talk quality and it is not a 3g phone itis a 2g phone i called at&t to have them send me a new sim they asked for a imei # when i gave it to them them told me that is was 2g and they do not used 2g phone anymore and the internet is slow that is because it is a edge network not 3g!!!! overall the phone is a 3 out of 10 n

This product arrived in excellent time. p
good p
The biggest downside to this phone is from China. It looks great. I've been using it about a week and already having charging/battery issues. Its definitely going back! n
I love it, the only problem is the camera its not very clear but its okay! p
The size of phone is good fast enough and convenient for Every day use and also fits in average hand.The battery is not very strong and Wireless is looking weak.if you need a phone for both talk and internet This is a very Economical option.venkata n
The phone is excellent at such a low price compared to other brands. fast, long battery life, I would give it five star if the phone was set properly. The large screen is so nice for a old person to read.I downloaded the Wechat I used most from either Lenovo store or Amazon store apps installed on it (sorry I do not remember). I did not find Google play when it arrived.you have to figure out how to change the default Chinese browser into a English one. Some things are still in Chinese although the language was initially set to be English. this seller have not done the right rooting as it described. But that does not prevent me enjoy the phone until now. Its default setting needs to be customized if you use gophone plan. You MUST turn off the data connection service to avoid automatic connecting and charging for the online time (Could be too late when you notice that).I will add more when I learn using other functions.Just find that when you insert 32G SD card, the machine response very slow. Do not recommend to try to use 32G Card. p
the phone is good i liked it its amaizing a loved it the only thing that i oreder in white and they send mi in blackbut is an amaizing phone p
This is the second smartphone I purchased (my first one is the same phone, in black). After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great. p
Positive Sides : Big screen, very nice colours , not bad camera for 5MP, fast in work, perfect body quality, long battery life, low priceNegative Sides : NOT LOADED WITH GOOGLE PLAY, a lot of chinese apps and some of them you can't uninstall (but you can root it to English or another language, if you have such knowledge) p
1- the manual don`t have english.just it. I like the phone, I start use now. I hope have no problema, becausethe manual is in chinise. p
This phone is good the android is a very intuitive an easy OS, the phone can do all that you plan, feel good and its very responsive. p
The delivery was earlier than expected and the cellphone is extremely fast. I have yet to experience trouble with it. This is the best cellphone I have ever bought! p
excellent good happy phone arrived earlier than expected I recomiendo this phone is great good quality good performance very fast if you want a big elegant white fast this phone is .. all you have is that this does not come dipositive is Spanish and I am from Dominican Republic .. acostumbro on me but I love is great I recommend it to all . battery lasts a long bino has good performance one but it is great p
Way better than my iphone 4. It feels like a phone but works like a tablet. Very fast and plenty of memory (with a 32gb card). It doesn't have the usual characteristics of a Chinese product. Fells like an LG. p
ok p
Usually after buying a unlocked phone off amazon I have a problem . BUT I LOVE THIS PHONE . I HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE ISSUE . I recommend this phone p
My cell phone doesn't charge right now, it out of power , I don't know where can I contact the seller! Will you help me? n
I am satisfied with the behavior of the apparatus further is fast , thin , light and beautiful , I would recommend! p

Good night I write you because Lenovos buy two phones A850 .As can be seen in July and after three months the phones began to fail presenting several problems, guindaban , were paid , was reteaban and could never communicate with vendendor , although they wrote repeatedly , nobody gave me answer or solution to the problem .For this reason the phone never served and lost my dollars.I really think a lack of respect.Waiting for your good offices ..Hoping that the company amazon take action.since Mr. YOMIKOO , I never gave me a solution ...Eulises carefully PeÃ±a n
very nic e p
I think that i can repair the phone with 50$ that they give to me but not, the phone just doesn't work at all, with anything turn on, i just hate it, is the worst phone that i ever had! Doesn't buy this, all of plastic and aluminium. Is a Stole n
The phone is lighting fast however it only allows you to change language settings to English and Chinese it wasn't routed in Goole play store it has a lenovo store that is in Chinese. Won't buy again. Amazon try to help but wasn't any help to me. n
I own one that I bought through dealextreme and it has been working really well, So many drops it has had that I don't remember, and that is the main reason why I am buying it again since I am quite clumsy with holding cells. Secondly, I think this cel is quite fast for the price, even though picture quality is not as great to pair it with my high def cameras, but just to point and click is ok. Hope it would come with more memory, but I could not complain since I the price seems to be right. p

Best Price-Value benefit, you have to deal with some chinese at the Lenovo on the Built-in apps, but 99.99% it's english and Lenovo it's a Great Brand p
I am very disappointed to this cellphone the box is not sealed I thought it's a brand new phone,do not buy this phone. n
Very good p
The A850 comes with Chinese & English language, you just can't have one or the other. The book on the warranty or instructions or heaven knows what it is, it's completly written in Chinese. It is of no use. This phone has things flashing and i need to find just what they mean, so to the internet I go. If I had known from the posting this language thing, I would not have bought this A850 unlocked lenovo android cellphone. n
Its operating now using my old sim card. p

goodnight, the product arrived in excellent condition. thank you very much p
When I first got the phone it was not charging so I had to email the company to see if they could help me on learning how to charge the phone. The company did emailed me back and now the phone is working fine. I had to take it to my phone company so they can help me set it up right. Some things are in Chinese. p

Greetings I am writing to tell you that I am very comfortable with the phone, filled all my expectations. thank you p
very good product p
The phone works well, meets my expectation. Only annoying thing is the message function p
Phone was very nice I charged it but could not get it to turn on. it could have been because there was no sims card, but that should not have prevented it from coming on. I went on line looking for a manual (in English) all I could find was a quick start guide. There was no other instructions to be found in, that scared me so I decided to send it back. If there were complete instructions in English I would have kept it n
wonderful p
an function phone. n
Don't buy this phone, I have a lot of issues with it such as: extremely slow, it takes a long time to open up apps ex. internet, messages and also the phone; volume, putting the phone on speaker doesn't help because you still won't be able to hear on it. n
thank you for refund. everything right p
Worst phone. Don't ever get this product. after using it for a few months l cant even charge it any more. I got two ,one for me and one for my husband and either phone is working now. my money just went down the toilet. n
bad phone, wouldn't turn on, no Manuel, no headphones, came late, just don't waste your time on this phone n
Bien.... p
Had very high expectations for this phone. I was coming from a galaxy s3. Out of the box I liked the look and feel of it. Turned it on and didn't mind the little bit of Chinese or Japanese writing that still lingerd. Put my sim card in and it powered up fine. Problems started when texting. After about 30texts it stopped displaying new texts. I would get notifications saying I had one but when I went to contact to view it wouldn't allow me to scroll to see them. Then the phone would be on silent mode even if I had selected other wise so I couldn't hear when I received texts. Turned the volume up full and it still didn't work. Next was the internet. Wi-Fi connection was fine when at home or work when it had a network to connect to but not while using AT&T network (my carrier). Tried everything and got somewhat close. Sometimes it would work briefly. After loading for a few minutes a page might display but if you tried to click on a link or the next page it would say no network connection. So no internet on the go or GPS.Also if you were sent a link in a text from a friend or colleague the phone said it didn't have the correct program to continue and wouldn't connect. All in all the phone was just SO GLITCHEY! Every day something new would pop up. Even if the internet worked I just didn't feel safe having this phone as my source of contact to the world, like it would crash at any moment. My s3 just blew this phone away. Even if everything worked right it still didn't stack up. The big screen was nice but not as clear as my S3, and it was so freaking slow loading movies and pictures and web pages.I recommend avoiding this phone and looking into something else. Pay more and get something more reliable. n
I've had the phone for one month. It is already turning itself on and having trouble turning back on. The port to charge it is messed up and no charger will hardly stay connected. The camera is AWFUL. The pictures are terrible and the flash doesn't work. I have never been so upset in a phone purchase in all my life. n
As a previous review, there is a false advertising here! The Android OS in this phone is pretty much in Chinese language with no Google Play in it!!! It's understandable given the broad censorship happening there. To have an operational phone in English you'll have to flash the phone. If you are not technologically savvy you wouldn't buying this. It's really frustrating, even the manual comes just in Chinese language. n
Works very well p
This company is worth and more rate very good attention, fast in response and very friendly also the equipment you buy them very well, actually there was no disgust everything was in order and up to date, the product acquired is an ideal team for students and upper level profecionales'm a lawyer and has proved very versatile and dynamic me for my work p
To keep it short Ill just say:This review is two parts - the 1st - this phone is amazing. Feels like 10K, looks like 10K, fast and clean. Benefits are there are MANY MANY roms to flash very easily. The phone feels like something you would want to own!The second - I RETURNED IT :-( . First is that you MUST check the ROM kernel. If it does not say "ROW" in the file name you will have a headache. Just that simple. But the most important is in does NOT run on the 850MHZ in 3G/HSPDA+. I repeat it is not a 850mhz Penta Band phone in upper bands. What does this mean for you? ATT, TMobile, and MVNOs (straight talk, ect) that run on these networks will ONLY GIVE YOU 2G speeds which are to be disbanded shortly. Very few places, mostly big cities, operate that 2100mhz in USA. So if you want it for USA - sad to say - we are gonna miss out on this one.I give it 4 stars for the fact that its a 10 star phone - but CANNOT be run in "todays" markets in the USA.Good luck all.NOTE: Purchased twice - 1st was AXOING = NO ROW, Chinese only!; 2nd - was APlusElek = Old Rom but WAS "ROW" so easy enough to work with for Google services. BUT NO USA p
excellent product, great quality, nice price. And indeed this unlocked for use with any telephone company. Only you have to verify that the 3G band works in your country. Plus, is a lenovo technology p
This is my second time buying a cellphone from amazon. As always, i did a heavy research BEFORE buying the phone and placing my order.My first impression of the phone was: Holy crap this is beautiful. Its thin, its slick and it is black and shiny all over the place! It is really something to admire.The first thing is: This phone is HUGE. Its totally a thing. And it wont stop being a thing. I mean it is a 5.5 inch screen, which makes this phone almost a tablet, which it is! so it is called a Phablet. The screen is very bright, crisp, and seriously, IPS? in my opinion the best choice for color and brightness,plus it saves battery. People complains that this phone doesn't have a 1080p screen, but really, if you can see the difference between the pixel density of this phone (aprox 200ppi ) and the pixel density of the iPhone (500 ppi) then your eyes must be better than the Kepler telescope. Go work at NASA or some stuff hehehehe. The screen size alone makes up for some things it is missing, and it totally should have, like a magnetometer. But don't get me wrong. This lil fella here is a powerhouse. It will make some phat rhymes and some ill beats for you if you play it rightThe feel of the phone is sturdy. It wont broke easily (nor i recommend you to try and break it. I mean come on) The back case has a good grip. Still i recommend you to get a phone cover, just in case. TPU will do or something more sturdier. I got one from http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EY7SS72/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1It has a LCD screen cover plus the case!!Inside the box, i got the phone (Durrrrr), Charger, Battery, A screen cover !!, a 4 GB micro SD!! , USB Cable, Wall Adapter And some cool earphones. Really complete set in my opinion. It has the bare minimum to go strolling.The charger is of good quality, sturdy, as is the USB cable and the wall adapter.About the Battery. It is a 2250 mAh battery. Now in the last two weeks i only charged the phone once every 2 days. So that gives you an approximate of 2 days of battery with GPS , WIFI and DATA NETWORK on. But that's me, I don't play much with the phone, and my heavy using apps are social ones. There is an application on the phone called Lenovo Power that manages battery in a smart way so it lasts longer. I suggest to learn it and use it.OK, opening the back case is nothing short of easy. It has a little dent to the lower right side that allows you to pull the back case fast and easy.Inside you will find 2 standard sized SIM CARD slots, Micro SD slot up to 32 GB , Phone Camera, Audio Speakers And battery slot. The phone accepts mini SIM CARDS too. Now about the DUAL SIM you must know that the First one(The one on the left) Is able to Use 3G capabilities while the other one cannot. Don't Sweat it, this is standard practice. The second SIM CARD slot will be and shall be used for a second phone line used only for calls. The audio Speaker is of good Quality. And LOUD. Good lord that thing is noisy hehehe.This phone Id is LENOVO A850. Its not a lenovo A820 and it is totally NOT a SAMSUNG GALAXY 2,3 OR 4. Nevertheless it has a bunch of qualities that will prove quite useful.Why do i mention that you ask? It is because of the camera. I kid you not. Its a 5 MP camera. Its a really good camera, but some People might want this phone to shoot pictures at a quality that is beyond the hardware. The pictures are excellent in my opinion and they will work with whats-app and other apps. It has a lot of modes like continuous shooting and auto-focus and you can set up camera quality up to 5 MP. You can record video at high quality too. It seems 1080p But in fact it is scaled from a lesser resolution. Not a problem for me tho. As always, this is a phone, not a camera.This phone has a MT6582M mediatek CPU. It is a Quad-core@1.3 GHz with a GPU MALI-400MP2. What does this Means for you? Its Fast. Trust Me , really fast. Your multimedia will play with no problems and your games will go like silk. Games like NOVA 3 and Anomaly Korea . Cool.It has 4 GB of internal memory that translates in a total of 2.31 GB in real usable space. It has too 1 GB of ram. This will Make the phone faster too, because you will be multitasking a lot with this Phone .Now going to the front side of the phone, you will find in the top The brand of the phone (LENOVO) in shiny silver letters, your 3.5 Audio Plug, power Button ,speaker, frontal camera , proximity sensor and a notification led . The frontal camera is a 1.2 MP one, it wont transmit lots of data to Skype and other apps so its ideal to make video calls. The top speaker Works like a charm as well as the proximity sensor and the 4 colors notification LED (Blue,Red,Orange,Green). I guess the LED is fully Configurable But haven't tried it yet .I will Update As Possible.In the Bottom you will find 3 silver shiny soft touch buttons, micro USB slot and microphone.The soft Buttons are from left to right:Menu Button, Home Button and Go back Button. They are shiny and silver and they wont have BACK-LIGHT. They will be visible enough in the darkness so that's it.The right side of the phone has the +/- volume buttons. The left side has nothing.OK that's with the Physical stuff. Now we go to Software.First Thing First. This Phone posses a high grade of heavy customization. And as such, it is necessary that if you are going to make use it, you are able to at least, follow instructions precisely and know your way around android OS or a computer. Sorry but that's it if you want to customize it. If not, Then don't worry ! Most Sellers are very kind and they will get you (if you ask them of course) the phone in your language be it Spanish or English or whatevs and they will customize it for you. But seriously, ask them. Don{t expect them to do it just for giggles. And certainly, do not ask after getting the phone or placing the order. Before is OK.The software is a tricky thing. My phone came with a Android 4.2.2 Rom that is called S128 Xiaomijie. It was a Chinese ROM but it came in English. I just wiped it and installed another one called S121, made by Linerty. Its more stable for me. Ill post the links At the end for you all that want to customize the phone.There is a silver lining to this. There is an announce from mediatek that this phone will get android 4.4 KITKAT at the end of this month (18/04/2014 as today) so if you go trough with the ROM change you will get the experience needed to update to KITKAT later. All this will be done manually. Bollocks.Anyways, android 4.2 goes really fast in this phone. Man, so FAST. you will get lot of apps that will make your experience with this phone something worth sharing. Your live wallpapers will be smooth, your wireless will be fast and your calls will always go trough. The android integration is really cool and it will save you lots of trouble when you set up your APN's , because at the time you insert your sim card it will get all the info you need for it.The GPS is really exact. you will get accurate measures up to +/- 2 meters. You wont need a internet connection for it to work. Only when you download your maps but apart from that, no.This phone Works Excellently in Venezuela. It works with Movilnet and Movistar (SIM CARD 1) and with Digitel (SIM CARD 2) . That{s for GSM calls. For 3G and data connection its only the SIM CARD 1.Over all, this phone is a great Purchase. I give it 10/10 points because the sheer awesomeness . Have in mind that this is a mid-end phone.And it kicks some rump.About The Seller. It was LightInTheBox. They sent Directly from China Via DHL. It was a Fast shipment (For me). I communicated with themand they were always attentive and fast at answering. Id go with them again in any case.At The time i bought the Phone it was worth 169$ . I guess it will get cheaper so get it if you can :DOne thing You must remember, This is no Samsung S5/S4 Phone, nor an Iphone, Not a tablet. But it will prove reliable with office applications and such .Have a Nice Day !Thanks For Reading This.-18/04/2014- p
it is ok the best cell phone and it is work ok in venezuelan for digitel , movistar o movilnet p
IF IS A SMARTPHONE EXCELLENT dig a little, IN SETTINGS YOU CAN CHANGE THE LANGUAGE TO ENGLISH OR SPANISH, IS QUICK AND HAS A LONG LIFE BATTERY AND IF YOU RECOMMEND GOOGLE PLAY LE MANS p
Great Phone for the price . Large screen for browse web , easy to use . Speed is ok at WIFI or 3G situation . only drawback is the battery life . It last for only 3-4 hours . you may need extra batter or mobile battery with you. You better check with seller to make sure that the phone is rooted to carrier neutral . I got is phone is pre-installed for China Unicom. It takes time to uninstall the carriers software p
good phone but the seller says it comes with googleplay and q is a lie and brings the most applications in Chinese n
I bought this phone and it works great...here's the scary thing, it speaks everything in Chinese...I speak English .... yikes!.....so, my husband took the phone to a phone dealer and had them change the language setting. If you buy the phone and see that it speaks another language..simply take in to a phone dealer. Other than that you have yourself a top of the line phone for a fraction of the price. p
Little visibility in light environments like outside in the shadow.Battery life could be better. It have a big screen which is very good for reading texts. p
its ok n
Great phone!!!! p
Exelente p
Good evening, I am writing to you to notify them that the product has already reached my hands in very good condition , but presents several problems, one of them is that one of the boxes phones come without security seal , the other without adhesives on the inner side ( compared to other phone that if brings, brings two one iridescent and one with a bar code ) , the other problem is presented and the greatest of these is that one of the phones ( which no adhesives) have problems getting the charger , you connect the original Lenovo charger that brought the package and this for 5 minutes maximum and then accepts it does not register because the charge light turns off and stops charging the battery . I wonder as is the procedure in such cases, if necessary forwarding phones and which direction.Thanking the prompt response to the problems that I present, I say goodbye.Gaudys Fermin. n
Excellent. p

The cell phone arrived several days before that the expected.The Mobil work excellent. It is fast, big and the screen looks very good. The only problem is the camera during the night, isn't good.But for the price, I think, is a good Mobil. p

It works excellent in Argentina , good quality p
This phone is 2G, even add says 3G, so internet runs super slow. The Second sim card does not work properly, its shame cause its a nice phone but with a few details. If you are using for calls, text and WiFi its OK. n
excelente muy bueno p
excelente muy bueno p
It's not the most up to date phone only Android 4.2. And it has other flaws. But for only 100 bucks, it is unbeatable quality. Beautiful design and it can easily pass for a phone that costs $300. Lenovo is a recognizable brand, so i trust that it is more durable than most no name cheap phones p
Excelente. p
Excellent p
The mobile is very good, there are only small details that make such uncomfortable using the button to activate the screen is in an awkward position. Otherwise very sastifecho. p
okay p
Features are amazing. Clean and neat. p
GREAT PHONE, EASY ACCESS TO ALL THE APPLICATIONS, WORKS PERFECTLY IN VENEZUELA, WE RECOMMEND p
Congratulection ..ok p
Uff I love this smartphone. Really work on Venezuelan's service... p
I liked it later gave to my friend.plan to buy another one when I return home to usa p
Nice phone for games. Worked well with straight talk p
excellent product, i came with some good stuff, as a pen drive, a case and a screen protector p
five star.. excellent p
The left side of the screen has a vertical area about 1/4 inch that has no touch response all the way up and down, the chinese software is retarded and is hard to correct or remove, despite being rooted and having superuser app preinstalled, when using multiple apps, the performance really starts to struggle, does not support OTG, and now youtube app has become glitchy for some unknown reason.Pros: large screen with decent resolution, large battery, and fm radio... but no A.M. For $100, it's a nice back up or temp phone. I'm looking to flash the rom to custom install in the future, I will update when completed. n
I like the phone..very nice camera p
odlican telefon i usluga! p
The phone is a good phone but yeah right but. Its only a 2G and very slow without using WiFi. n
Very good p
Great thanks for all number-responsibility came good. p

I asked other people questions on Amazon about whether it would work with digi mobil (movistar). Everyone said it would. It required a sim adapter.So now on to my review.Anyone who gives this phone 5 stars has never owned a premium smartphone. For this review I am comparing to my Samsung Galaxy S5Touchscreen: With the factory provided screen protector on, sometimes its unresponsive, sometimes it freezes. I have to hold down on a touch screen button most of the time for the phone to realize its being touched and then less than half the time the button will respond. Take the screen protector off and it works marvelously, but then you risk damaging the screen.Network: Movistar DigiMobil (pay as you go plan) When I got my SIM I bought a Samsung Galaxy Young 2 to use it in. No major issues aside from phone size. In the young 2 my whatsapp worked fine and I could send texts and make phone calls in my whatsapp on only my mobile network no Wifi. Now that my SIM is in the Lenovo, it will not allow me to transmit in whatsapp at all unless connected to wifi.-In addition, there is no Internet or google play access without wifi.This is a s*** phone and is being returned n
useless and in Chinese n
Good phone for the price p
Nice phone but the battery dies at the middle of the day with a medium-low use. n
Excellent! p
Lenovo pone is not a pone kids toy.pleas remove from the market. Thank you .do I have to rate ? For what ? n

It's awesome. I bought one for my husband, one for myself. p
The phone is quite big, and perfect for my dad. He mostly use the phone to play Candy Crush and send texts and he totally loves it! It's fast and a perfect deal for the price. p
Excellent p
BUEN CELULAR p
it's a good phone, but sent defective. No sound when they call, so should only be used with headphones and is not ideal. I have to take it in for repair. n
The phone is not working. n
EXCELENTE p
good mobile. p
Nice product and reasonable shipping speed. Language setting was somewhat a challenge as the the initial language was "Greek", but with the help of Google Translator, it was changed to English eventually. p
I didn't bought it for myself, though my customer was please with it! n
It's a decent for the price.. I've had this one for more than 6 months. The cons are 1) I am pretty frequently unable to connect to the internet using my home WIFI or my carrier. The connection is slow when I'm able to connect. 2) the phone randomly changes settings, including the merging of several contact's phone numbers onto one contact's name. And finally 4) the selfie camera is awful. Pros 1) it does everything else I'd expect a smart phone to do and 2) it does have Google play n
Is good cell phone n
Amazing phone. Cables and case included, also screen pritectors. Amazing phone! p
Excelent p
Excellent, it meets the requirements requested p
1. phone comes with no manual.2. no support from lenovo usa. their primary focus is on lab tops not phones.3. tried to get manual on line no luck.4. has programs in chinese which cannot be removed.5. 5.5 screen is great + clarity! n
good p
it's not all good... it's basically a Chinese phone with no google play in it ... i just returned the product within 24 hours since it go delivered.... i would suggest not to buy this phone.... n
A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT, TEAM COMES IN CHINESE AND ENGLISH ONLY, NOT AS DESCRIBED IN SPANISH, THE WORST IS THAT NO LONGER THAN ANDROID GOOGLE HAS INSTALLED AND PLAY APK download it as NOT PERMITTED TO RUN THE APP OR ANY OTHER OF GOOGLE INC.UNA TOTAL DECEPCIÃ“N, EL EQUIPO VIENE SOLO EN CHINO E INGLES, NO EN ESPAÃ‘OL COMO DESCRIBE, LO PEOR ES QUE NO TIENE ANDROID YA QUE NO TIENE INSTALADO GOOGLE PLAY Y AL BAJARLO COMO APK NO PERMITE EJECUTAR LA APP NI NINGUNA OTRA DE GOOGLE INC. n
I found that all features worked properly and without a glitch. Mine came with Google Play included and it worked fine. The operating system is proper English. I only found that a calendar application had some Chinese characters, but I do not use that application and I disabled it. As it is usual in all Android phones, it came with many applications that cannot be uninstalled, but I disabled all those that I do not use and they disappear with icon and all. Screen is big and very nice, but the phone still fits in a shirt pocket, even with a case ( that I also bought at Amazon). I used a SIM in Miami and I have another one in Costa Rica, where I travel frequently and both worked fine the first time.The phone came without any setup manual and some newbies may have to download one from the Internet. p
Everything works just like what it described. I am very satisfied with this product. So far, surprisely, no problems at all. I would recommend this to anyone. p
the product represents everything the brand suggests a good quality product well packaged with all accessories and parts in a good overall condition new mind as it appears in the image of the company so grateful I recommend the product p
Good Performance, Touchscreen and Display OKGoogle Play Store and apps are working without any problem. But make sure that your operator supports 3g with this phone. p
Is a very good smartphone for its prize, its cpu is really fast and its big screen let you enjoy the apps in a great size p
I've tried several phones over years, including two Nexus and Galaxy Note I and none of them approach this one.Very fluid, easy to use and everything work just as described.The screen seems large on paper, but I can guarantee you that you will not feel it once you start using it.I received the phone in time and the seller did a great job. Playstore was preinstalled, but was taking too much time to come up, so I downloaded Neflix from Internet directly and install, then the Playstore started to work. Even without Playstore preinstalled, you can still install apps from the Playstore webpage. This is no restriction at all p
Excellent price / quality ratio, although the operating system is modified to a version of lenovo, I hope you soon have available the versions "cosinadas" with more versatility. p
Customer Service replied very quickly to my emails and was able get the phone to me by Christmas Eve.Researched thru basic phones with the minimum requirements (1gb ram, 1.2Ghz, large screen).Thought the 5.5" screen would be la bit large but it is in line with Galaxy Note 3.Standard items: Dual SIMM, Dual camera. Jelly Bean.Pros: Large screen. Price.Cons: Camera quality is less than average for 5mps.Issue: The Microsoft EXCHANGE app is installed, but no option create an Outlook account. Using the (limited) web version for now.Need to engage Customer Service for assistance. n
This is my first Android phone. I've only had iPhones up till now but my 4S is starting to show it's age so instead of spending well over $700 for the iPhone 5C I decided to try out Android because I have a Nexus 7 and like it.This Lenovo A850 had the specs I was looking for and the feedback that convinced me to try it out especially since it only cost a little under $160 on Amazon including shipping.Yeah I had to wait for it to be delivered from China but it didn't take all that long. It did have it's caveats like only 4GB memory storage and 2 of that was a MicroSD card, but after swapping it for a 32GB card and flashing it with a cleaner version of Lenovo's iteration of Android 4.2.2, I'm really enjoying the power and responsiveness of this Mediatek processor. The 1GB of RAM seems ample for my general use but I've watched videos of decent gameing handled by it as well. I also like the battery life but that didn't stop me from buying an extra battery and battery charger since I can just swap out batteries making it never really needing to sit and charge unless I want to.Bottom line is if you know your way around Android even if your just a novice like me, you're gonna really like this phone! Just keep your expectations equal to the price you're paying. p
was ordered on Friday in LightInTheBox Home Store and was delivered by DHL (!) next Tuesday - very impressive! A very good mobile with 5.5 very bright display. the single cons - contained a China-English softwear version and needed to be upgraded, because even you chose English version sometimes you see Chinese letters.the softwear changing process took approximately 15 minutes - and you have a very good mobile at the price some less than $160. p
Thank you for you gifts that you sent in the package Screen protectorGood Performance, Touchscreen/Display OKGoogle Play Store and apps are working without any problem.Perfect usable as smartphone/tablet combination: 2 in 1 device p
Good Performance, Touchscreen/Display OK, (it is quite big!) => good for seniorsGoogle Play Store and apps are working without any problem.Only thing that worry me is the chinese language in boot menu, chinese messages or menu entry show up very seldom deeper in the settings.I am using it in Germany with my local language settings: That GUI works fine.Declared "Root" is pseudo. But it is seriously rootable, my son got it after some minutes web search.Perfect usable as smartphone/tablet combination: 2 in 1 device!I bought it at Lightonlines. p
The lenovo A850 is a Chinese phone and as such the android operating system on the phone is all in Chinese and you cant install google play. To get around that you have to root the phone and install a custom ROM in English, hence why I bought the phone it being "rooted with google play" and all. That is not the case at all, the phone is programed in Chinese and as such everything is written in Chinese characters, google play does not function at all with the standard operating system on the phone. seller has used false advertising in the product description, and is a bad man who makes me cry. PHONE DOES NOT HAVE GOOGLE PLAY PRE INSTALLED, YOU WILL HAVE TO FLASH AND ROOT THE PHONE TO INSTALL IT n
I got this from "Light In the Box" seller. It is not loaded with Google Play, but came with Chinese mobile browsers and apps, and took me some time to figure out how to download Chrome. How I did it is still a wonder. It is definitely not loaded with Google Play. Even when logged in to Google Play on the phone's Chrome browser and tried to download its app and other Google Play apps, I kept getting the "You don't have any devices" indicator. I checked Google Play's list of compatible devices, Lenovo A850 is one of the supported devices. So, I really do not know why can't and shouldn't I have Google Play on this phone!!!The device, however, came with the Amazon app.Due to limited understanding of its Chinese language apps, I find it difficult to get the most out of this device.Prospective buyer, if Google Play and Chrome are a must for you, I suggest you verify with a seller before buying. n
This is a good smart phone ,First of all the device is fast "NO LAGGING"The software nice ,battery life more than accepted for daily use.Feels good in the hand ,but the camera not really what I expected.For the cost it is a great deal. (Quad core + 1GB RAM + Big screen +not bad camera + nice finishing and style ). p
Thank you for you gifts that you sent in the package Screen protector and Case they are very nice thank you again. p
Very nice product for the price. p
I am very happy that I fulfilled my expectations, I love the phone. phone is very good for the price you can recommend 100% p

The phone is a good alternative to the IPhone and samcung galaxy series n
Since received it the phone does not turn on @ all, does not work. Bad phone n
The phone is fantastic, better than I thought.! only bad thing is that this in Chinese.. I am from Venezuela and I can not change the language to Spanish ... p

Works well, great value. p
all fine p

Very Good p
lo vendi p
This phone is made for China. If You plan to use the phone outside China, then do NOT buy. The phone is configured to work only in China, even the time/clock on the phone is set to China time zone and you cannot change it. The phone will not accept any changes - you cannot install new apps or make changes to the pre- installed apps - and there are a number of Chinese junk apps pre-installed. The phone will often give you messages in Chinese language. Also, it crashes frequently, and you will get several error messages. It needs to be rebooted frequently. Any changes you made will get lost each time it reboots. Your text messages and contact will even disappear randomly. The battery drains out quickly. Stay away from this piece of junk if you are not living in China. n
i love it but its unfortunate it does not accompanied with English manual or guide p
I was hurt a week later provide defective goods n
i like it good seller and nice cellphone very useful this phone can use in the philippines nothing problem at all p
Todo perfecto, p
Excelente! p
I think that i can repair the phone with 50$ that they give to me but not, the phone just doesn't work at all, with anything turn on, i just hate it, is the worst phone that i ever had! Doesn't buy this, all of plastic and aluminium. Is a Stole n
The phone is lighting fast however it only allows you to change language settings to English and Chinese it wasn't routed in Goole play store it has a lenovo store that is in Chinese. Won't buy again. Amazon try to help but wasn't any help to me. n
I own one that I bought through dealextreme and it has been working really well, So many drops it has had that I don't remember, and that is the main reason why I am buying it again since I am quite clumsy with holding cells. Secondly, I think this cel is quite fast for the price, even though picture quality is not as great to pair it with my high def cameras, but just to point and click is ok. Hope it would come with more memory, but I could not complain since I the price seems to be right. p
excelente....!!! p

This is a very basic no frills phone. Does the bare minimum for the most part. Still having trouble with downloading MMS messages on straight talk. However the internet is working, so if you have any idea how to fix my MMS issue it might just change my review n
very good! excellent equip p

its a great phone...but it needs more internal memory n
The look is great. Instructions are in Chinese. I only speak/English. Difficult in learning some new "tapping" techniques because a light tap several times doesn't work. Screen went black after 1 week. Requested return slip.... Day three still waiting....... n

excelent for the price p
Absolutely not recommended. This product should be exlusively for the Asian market while Lenovo does not provide technical service worldwide for its smartphones, its interface for PC is in Chinese Language. Recomended for Consumers who have advanced knowledge of programming or Chinese (of course) P.D: The item has technical issues with the charger slot, but knowing how they deal with the customers i've actually prefer not even write them. Never again. n
Excellent p
i love it p
Great phone for the price. p
Decent price for a decent piece of equipment. The camera is not bad, the processor is decent. What absolutely ruins this phone is the ADWARE GARBAGE attached to it.The Adware does NOTHING (because the ads themselves aren't even sized properly you don't even know what's being promoted) but slows up the phone. It pops up every so often in settings, launching aps etc. Additionally having used close to a dozen MTK phones Lenovo did a poor job of altering the android OS. It's hard to use, not configurable and clunky.And finally I cannot figure out how to change the MMS settings to consolidate group texts - a known problem with earlier generation android phones.I think those that have the time (I don't) to root this phone will have a much better experience. In stock software form it's not better than the other Android phones on the market - despite the slightly lower price. n
perfect p
the best phone you can buy for this price I love it p
exelente p
excellent product. p
very good p
Excellent phone for the price, dual sim, unlocked, with Google Play store. I even got CWM custom recovery to install on it and now I can experiment with other firmware. Please note that most of the CWM installation instruction will NOT work because they were written for the wrong version of the phone. This is the so called å‘å“¥ç‰ˆ, you would need to know a bit of Chinese and find the right CWM image for it.The resolution is of course on the low side for such a big phone. On the other hand, I purchased it for my mother and configured it with huge fonts in any case, so it didn't bother me. p
Excellent phone functions recommend p
I'm so surprise about this phone...great quality! In cheap price!!!!happy happy the only cons is the long wait to be shipped.but its worth! p
gracias p
my favor phone p
some features are not working for me n
It came without the headphones. And in the box and publication says q is included n
Good p
feliz exelente p
unfortunately phone did not open. so it dosen work. the seller dont care it. i think when rooted malfunctioned. dont get. i get 2 one . one of them is trush. n
I am still getting used to it. It is unlocked but It was not rooted. It is subject to annoying "GSM Buzz" near my radio/TV/speakers. I like the dual SIM slots. I use one plan for voice and another for data/text. Or you can use each SIM for different countries services when travelling. The manual and warranty is in Chinese, but it's easy to figure out. It's a phone: Insert battery, Insert SIM, insert micro SD, insert charger cable, charge, tap on Settings. That's pretty much what a quick-start guide will say.The ear buds are cheap. So buy your own ear buds. n
Okey p
It's very very good buy it p
Bad cell phone n
Battery dies too quickly and picture quality is poor. n
Good phone i would like another one p
Great phon..... luv it p
i like it. i love it p

First this phone is huge! I absolutely love it! It is super fast and the camera and video is very clear and crisp! I'm so glad I took a chance on it!UPDATE! Still love my phone but I cant figure out how o move apps to sim card1 seems like this is a problem alot of people are facing1 I dont know what rooting is and to save myself from messing up my phone I will take it to best buty geek squad and let them fix it!Feeling aggravated! Also is their an update to a higher version like Lolipop. Skittles or whatever they calling it now lol? p
Nice for the price, very big! p

dynamic isn't working n
Not a great phone but good value for money p

Great Product p
Great product! p
this phone has poor talk quality and it is not a 3g phone itis a 2g phone i called at&t to have them send me a new sim they asked for a imei # when i gave it to them them told me that is was 2g and they do not used 2g phone anymore and the internet is slow that is because it is a edge network not 3g!!!! overall the phone is a 3 out of 10 n
toda una estafa n
Excellent cellphone its great p
Works Good! p
phone did not work when I got it. Sent it back to CHINA and the seller will not refund my money. Money wasted. n
Good quility mat,bad sound n
Regrettably . I get me wrong this phone factory . check it caught and then to the days not wanted to turn more , I write from Venezuela 's prodcuto buy on October 26 but not as return , nor I noticed if I had guarantee this serves me pick to be more tuned when buy n
This product does not have any manual, instructions or warranty in English. Everything in the box is in china. So you better learn China language if you are desperate to buy this smartphone n
Phone never worked straight out of the box.....I want my money back! n
Just got mine, no earphones though n
Came early. Unlocked as they said. All is well. Will buy more. p
Thanks p
The unlock button came with a little problem, it has to be pressed really hard in order to unlock the phone, but aside from that it's allright p
Battery life is very short, it is not withstanding not even a day. n
The size of phone is good fast enough and convenient for Every day use and also fits in average hand.The battery is not very strong and Wireless is looking weak.if you need a phone for both talk and internet This is a very Economical option.venkata n
The phone is excellent at such a low price compared to other brands. fast, long battery life, I would give it five star if the phone was set properly. The large screen is so nice for a old person to read.I downloaded the Wechat I used most from either Lenovo store or Amazon store apps installed on it (sorry I do not remember). I did not find Google play when it arrived.you have to figure out how to change the default Chinese browser into a English one. Some things are still in Chinese although the language was initially set to be English. this seller have not done the right rooting as it described. But that does not prevent me enjoy the phone until now. Its default setting needs to be customized if you use gophone plan. You MUST turn off the data connection service to avoid automatic connecting and charging for the online time (Could be too late when you notice that).I will add more when I learn using other functions.Just find that when you insert 32G SD card, the machine response very slow. Do not recommend to try to use 32G Card. p
the phone is good i liked it its amaizing a loved it the only thing that i oreder in white and they send mi in blackbut is an amaizing phone p
This is the second smartphone I purchased (my first one is the same phone, in black). After my experience with my 1st Lenovo A850, I realize that the cheapest price does not mean the phone is best setup to fit my use. I got this one from PriceAngels. Before I placed my order, I confirmed with the seller on setting the language to English, rooting and installing GooglePlay. The seller was very prompt in getting back to me. For that, I thank you!The phone's screen quality is good (although not as high end as HD) for the price level. The touch response is as good as any high end smartphones. Since this phone has been rooted, I could install any app/tools I want.things for Lenovo A850 should be noted (for good reasons) --1. The FM radio is very clear. You cannot use the FM radio on speaker, you must use an ear piece.2. This phone has a built in GPS. I installed a GPS app that does not need internet connection to the phone. The GPS app has slow responses, so, it is hard to tell how good is the GPS until I try some more. If non-web GPS app works well, then I do not have to use DATA for direction at all. For now, my GPS device will remain in the car...3. Although the phone's language has been set to English, some status updates / indicators on the phone are still in Chinese. This does not bother me. I don't think you can have EVERYTHING set to English or another language.4. The phone boots up to some Chinese mobile company. This is one setting I would love to change but don't know how.This phone still gets 5-star rating from me. This is a great phone and the price is great. p
Positive Sides : Big screen, very nice colours , not bad camera for 5MP, fast in work, perfect body quality, long battery life, low priceNegative Sides : NOT LOADED WITH GOOGLE PLAY, a lot of chinese apps and some of them you can't uninstall (but you can root it to English or another language, if you have such knowledge) p
1- the manual don`t have english.just it. I like the phone, I start use now. I hope have no problema, becausethe manual is in chinise. p
This phone is good the android is a very intuitive an easy OS, the phone can do all that you plan, feel good and its very responsive. p
The delivery was earlier than expected and the cellphone is extremely fast. I have yet to experience trouble with it. This is the best cellphone I have ever bought! p
excellent good happy phone arrived earlier than expected I recomiendo this phone is great good quality good performance very fast if you want a big elegant white fast this phone is .. all you have is that this does not come dipositive is Spanish and I am from Dominican Republic .. acostumbro on me but I love is great I recommend it to all . battery lasts a long bino has good performance one but it is great p
Way better than my iphone 4. It feels like a phone but works like a tablet. Very fast and plenty of memory (with a 32gb card). It doesn't have the usual characteristics of a Chinese product. Fells like an LG. p
It is a nice phone p
Excellent seller recommend 100% p
the only situation is tha you have to upload a new software.all in Chinese!!! what??? yes all in chinese p
f p
fine fine p
Excellent! p
This product arrived in excellent time. p
good p
The biggest downside to this phone is from China. It looks great. I've been using it about a week and already having charging/battery issues. Its definitely going back! n
I love it, the only problem is the camera its not very clear but its okay! p
THANK YOU SO MUCH! ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION p
Good afternoon is to inform the team 5.5-Inch Lenovo A850 Unlocked 3G has the following fails, the computer does not recognize any SIM card into its two slots, I wonder if the team is still in warranty and see what we can do no more than say thank you very much. p
the phone can be put in Spanish ? n
Came with only Chinese instructions. Defective and would not charge for many days. Had to return to Amazon. n
Exelente p
I sent the phone to Colombia, and They had to change the battery because the one the phone came with, did not work. They had to pay almost $50 to replace it.The phone is working as expected after that. n
I received it, charged the battery and nothing happened. The photo was DOA. Nada. Returned and got my money back to buy another brand. n
Genial cell phone, fast and beautiful. The camera is us their main attraction. p

Good p
Excellent p
It's Ok! I went back to my old phone because so much was not working right on this phone and I haven't had time to call to see if it was a phone problem or phone carrier problem. I could call and receive calls, and text and receive texts, but none of the data would work, it wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't view anything nor download anything. I got an error with everything I tried. So I put my SIM card back in my old phone for now. When I have the chance, I'll try to see what's wrong with this phone because it seems like a really nice phone, and I love the size of the screen. n
excellent p

This phone is sleek, slim, and sexy. The screen is big (5 inches) but the picture quality could be better. Sound is good and loud I can hear it from different rooms if I want.2 Sims card can get confusing but it is a nice touch . There is a spot for extra memory and I have not had a problem with connectivity . This is a great phone for the price. p
I'm from Venezuela and is a great phone. p
gracias p
There is no customer support for Lenovo phones. "See our website." I am unable to answer the phone. It rings and goes to voice mail. Screen says "Anti-Tapping." ???? This would be a great phone for the price if someone could answer my questions. n
Very well!!excellent p
Excellent! Very well and efficient p

buen producto p
Excelente p
Excellent product !! p
Just received this phone and I'm very impressed with the quality. I've had a Lenovo computer and it was a great device. The phone thus far seems so too. I recently purchased a POSH 5.7 phone that was horrible. Very sluggish and froze. This phone however is very fast is comparison. The phone I was trying to replace with these recent purchases was the Samsung G 3. It was a great phone but after two years and many falls needed to be replaced. This Lenovo feels and looks of the same quality, unlike the POSH. I highly recommend it! I will keep this updated if I encounter any problems. p
very good p
As described p
my husband love this phone a lot..style & performance superb... p
yes p
Excelente p
very good p
So far , so good . Works well p
It's a nice phone for such a low price p
This product shut down the screen when u use to audio/video call in skype,viber,& messenger! The screen will turn back on only when u remove the battery and turn on again! Factory deffect! n
The camara sucks n
The screen color quality is crisp as most leading brands. The volume is loud in ear & the speakerphone as well ( I like ) The only thing I dislike is all the China Apps installed. I've disabled most & there are a few things that still have the chinese language, however, considering the processing speed, screen clarity, & price, I'm keeping it :) p
quality team recommend them to everyone on amazon. p
Very nice.arrived on time. I love it. p
Excellent! p
the product is good but the English language still have settings showing in Chinese and its does not have google play.is there any change you provide more details on how I can get full version to download in English that I can install in the phones? n
Its lovely ! My brother in law loves it so far. p
bien p

according to specs this phone was supposed to work with my track phone sim card n
For any further clarification, please contact us p
Sounded like both the person I called and I were under water... n
This phone is huge! doesn't fit in pocket and has poor instructions. (Can't figure out how to turn on the light).Also, the phone won't work with my sim card which works in other phones. This was a total waste of money for us. We can't use it. n
Haven't used it too much but seems to work well. Battery lasts a long time! p
Get it for my father in law since my mother in law say that he say he can't hear the ringtone so now he complain is too loud which is good he hear it. Other than that love it so much that he finally don't complain he can't hear it anymore but now complain too loud hahaha p
Wouldn't allow me to transfer contacts. n
You can here it ring but you can't talk on it to low and I don't. Use mind now p

I LOVE THIS PHONE. IT'S REALLY WORTH IT. AMAZON IS VERY EFFICIENT. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORKS PLEASE DON'T CHANGE. p
Bought this phone as a factory-refurb. When it arrived, I plugged it in to charge and the splash screen came up... great I thought and walked away. Looked an hr later to check the progress and nothing had changed! No status bar, nothing! This should have been my first indication of trouble. Unplugged, plugged, unplugged, plugged and then the status bar came up...A cool feature is that the phone gives an audible alert when the battery is full! But then it was a witch to get it to turn on! Hold the button, wait for splash screen, wait to see if it initializes... if/when it doesn't, take the back off, take the battery out and start all over... usually 4-5 times before the phone would initialize! At first, I just figured this was a consequence of the battery being completely dead but nope... had to go through this EVERY time the phone was turned off!So I returned it (under the 30 day warranty) and the seller sent a new phone. Great! Well, I couldn't get the new phone past the splash screen no matter what I did!!!So, as far as features once I did get the first phone to work...The music player is really pretty nice! The built-in speakers sound great for a phone! The touch screen is responsive and the phone feels great in your hand! And, the wifi was pretty cool... BUT (and now the bad)... you can't see anything on the screen in direct sunlight! the headphone jack is proprietary. And, there aren't a lot of apps... I mean, even the facebook "app" was essentially a bookmark to the FB webpage. For this price point, I wasn't expecting an iPhone but seriously, this phone left a lot to be desired!So, my opinion is that this phone is a POS... 1/2 star for the phone working nicely when it worked, 1/2 star for the features, and 1 star for the music player sounding so great... Don't bother... n
I purchased this phone and didn't work n
This item is terrible, the worst thing I ever brought. I found out this is the Japanese version of the M8 so it doesn't work with any service here. n
The phone worked very good the first month, then it started freezing up all the time and wont come on half the time n
im loven it p
only 1 star because this phone looks good it supports metro and t mobile but the signal is s***ty instead of a 3g signal it has 2 small E's the internet is extremely slow i wouldn't recommend this phone for more than 50 dollars i haven't had any unwanted downloads its just the phone doesnt work for the plan i have which is 4g i would downgrade to 3g but it stil doesnt work so BE AWARE THAT THIS PHONE MAY NOT BE A SAFE BUY IF YOU LIVE IN AREAS WHERE CONNECTIONS CAN BE IFFY n
Didn't like the phone at all had it for a week and bought another one. Service wasn't good kept turning on and off can't download anything on to it. n
My PHONE HASN'T TURNT ON BEEN ON THE CHARGER FOR THE LONGEST n
It wasn't unlocked like it was supposed to be. I couldn't use it and had to return it. n
Excellent phone great size friendly interface could be faster but still has a good speed behind it's name camera quite fine if you ask me.......sad to say i got the phone February the 8 or so and the person who I refer to as bother and the person I refer to as mother destroyed it just last night it's like my heart took a dive into hell.......but eh the buy it again button will be pressed cause I love em phones p
Love it. Thanks p
I didn't like this purchase at all the phone suppose to be unlocked but I have no service the phone is sitting in the box it came in n
The phone don't work right it freezes up on me n
Great p
It's ok but it needs a better case n
nice one my wife is really enjoying the pnone p
The screen lags a bit, but is very clear. Camera is alright, takes pics tho. So far I can play most of my games. Netflix can be played and speakers are at a great volume. Overall it's pretty good for the price. p
How do I find a cases for this phone p
after buying this cell for my daughter, apx one month later it had 6 trojan viruses that coould not be fixed. so i had to buy ANOTHER CELL PHONE AND SIM CARD CAUSE THE NEW CELL WASNT COMPATABLE WITH NEW PHONE. n
The screen stopped working hours after the delivery, the camera sucks, it's slow, it was bigger than expected, and there is very low storage to begin with. Never get this phone, I'll be sending mine back to the company for a refund if you have the phone or want it, don't. n
Don't buy this phone, it came with a porno malware that doesn't go away, freezes up and lockes down. n
I do not recommend. n
it doesnt even cute on now n
ok p
The phone is amazing other than the worthless camera. I used to love this phone but now I hate it, it downloads apps on it's own and it has a virus on it. Don't buy this phone its not worth it. n
This phone is 2g I could only use it on wi-fi for things besides phone calls and text and sometime didn't even receive texts. n
The phone I receive would not read my verizon chip when I place it in the Slot. And while trying to send it back it costs me $25.00 to send it back to Seller in China. And I really need me another phone. Thanks JessicaYou may contact me at 843-709-3118 n
Awful product. Don't buy it! n
Don't know what's its like wait to see but I did hear it's a great phone p
It's OK... p
Supposed to be a brand new unlock phone. The phone is no good, seem to be used and didnt work like a brand new phone at all. I dont recommend this phone to no one. Touch screen didnt work at all, you cant even reset the phone at all. Had it for 1 day and returning it now n
This phone is a generic piece of garbage sent driectly from China. No way to return it. I have barely used it, have no photos, videos, or music, etc., and keep getting an error message that the internal storage is running out and I need to free up some space. The message prevents me from using the phone. DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE!!!!!!!!! n
Very satisfy p
These phones do not receive the internet at all do not buy them internet do not come in Metro PCS will not activate them the SIM code is fake do not buy them phones have been stolen that is why internet will not work Sam coats are fake do not buy them can't stress it enough do not n
This phone just didnt hold up to my expectations of what I thought it would be. There's a lot wrong with it n
Built in malware n
It is very beautiful and really smart! However it was missing USB cord ? if you have one please send me one. Carolyn Ensley p
Ok p
My pacage arrive whitout cellphone n
this phone is buggie i got it for me and my boyfriend because some people in the reviews was saying its a good phone. we hate this phone and is very soon getting a new oneit pops up random addswont stay connected to internetturns on and off by its selfand much more n
It would be perfect if I could find instructions for operating it. It did not come with any instruction manual. p
so slow and downloaded viruses and keyboard stopped working n
It isn't worth it n
bad n
This item is nothing what is suppose to be at all. Very dissapointed in this product you can not use internet now Wi-Fi norCalls or texts. Very dissatisfied n
I got my cell phone,but no SIM card was not include.why ,cause I know every cells phone comes with a SIM card. n
I can't get it turned on thur straight talk I thought it was unlocked n
Not A Good Camera ! n
Does not work with straight talk n
The sound is blocked. It's not functioning properly as I was expecting it n
Happy ðŸ˜Š p
This phone does work on walmart family moble, HOWEVER, it is very slow, downloads random apps that I never even a proved. If I had known the phone was going to be like this I would never wasted 80$ on it. This is what I get for trying to go the cheep route. n
After 3 days the screen on this phone stopped working and I'm very pissed off !!!!! There is no way to contact the seller to try another one and send this one back. Now I don't have a phone !! I wasted my money !!! n
I hate this phone I will never tell someone to bye a phone off amazon!!!!! Worst phone ever!!!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ n
The phone never worked n
thanks p
Perfect p
Not worth ordering went hay wire n
I never got the second one p
Like other people stated, came with porno malware that does not go away after a factory reset. n
Slightly bigger than I expected and shuts off and restarts randomly for no apparent reason. n
Just don't buy it please this phone sucks @$$ never spent my money on something and regretted it until now smh n
My blow out after a few months. Can I get replaced phone ðŸ“ž. Boost mobile phone 5 or 6 inch. n
My phone turns on by it self. N i cant download no apps without it kicking me out. So im giving it a 2 until i get something better. n
Wonderful love it p
Didn't work n
This phone was not even accessible on my plan. They could not even find it to connect the phone with my carrier. very dissatisfied. n
This phone looks nice but its only 2g. When I tried to use this phone with my phone carrier it would not work.The 2g is tooo slow and even on wifi I could not go to the internet. This phone is crap and I felt like I had a flip phone that just looked nice. n
I wish it was better and that it wasn't so easy to break n
Again you cannot hear without a blue tooth or earphones. Also the phone is giving me a lot of problems and I'm ready to return it. n
No it did not..I could not get it activated. Was not a good phone at all. n
I hate the phone it took picture of me randomly and it downloaded over 10 apps I didn't authorize it to download it is A bad phone to order it used over 10gbs to do that and I coundnt even delete them I hated this phone I wanted to throw it out-of the window it is not worth the money I spent on it promise that DO NOT ODER THIS PHONE NOT WORTH IT PROMISE n
Brought this for my cousin and she loved it p
Bought as a Xmas present for wife. By the time she opened it, selected a carrier, got their SIM and installed it the return period was up. While inputting contacts she started getting porno popups. Tried to reset to factory setting but the Porn is "deeply rooted" so the phone may have come with the malware installed. Its trash! n
Worst phone i ever had. I literally had it for a month, and its toast. It downloads virus after virus ON ITS OWN! Camera sucks, and it takes forever to make and recieve calls. That's what i get for going the cheap route.. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž n
This was the worst phone I have used . It doesn't even work . n
I bought 2 one for myself and one for my wife. They were great for the first two days then at the same time caught a virus that destroyed them instantly and we had to buy new phones it was awful I wouldn't buy them again n
keep going off and not able to use for the last 2 weeks n
Quick delivery and better quality than I exspected. Thank you! p
The phone is weak it would not charger Facebook work sometimes my messager don't work at it hang up in the middle of call n
This phone sucks the data is terrible if you have a SIM card the data you pay for isn't transferred. The phone only has G not 4G or even 3G it looks nice but that's it. n
It is a very good phone every body like it . p
Yes...no problems husband love it. p
I ordered this phone thinking I could use it on my boost mobile service when I got the phone and inserted my sim card it kept saying it couldn't read or that my sim card wasn't inserted I tried calling boost mobile and they said they couldn't get 2 work thru there system so I took it up 2 the store and even they said they couldn't get it 2 switch I'm highly unsatisfied with the phone due to it being an unlocked phone and it suppose to be good for any service and it's not working at all for my phone n
Bought this for a Friend,She likes it very much. p
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!! I've had it for several months (3-16) and it is a nightmare!! It is essentially a HTC M8. It has programming in it which cannot be deleted from China and does not 'hold' updated programmed information from Droid! It randomly does what it wants! Calls people, calls voice mail, flashes, incompatible with bluetooth, won't accept/see additional sim card so it stores everything on the phone's sim which means, you can't take pictures/video, voice record . . . nothing! And, OMG it is so SLOW ON DIALING OR ANYTHING ELSE, it must have been built during the first Apollo Mission to the Moon. A nightmare!!!!! I'm going to attempt to return it to Amazon!!! This product should NEVER BE BOUGHT BY ANYONE WHO NEEDS A RELIABLE PHONE THAT CALLS PEOPLE! n
Phone is pretty good headphones are loud but the case doesn't protect it. Haven't activated it yet but its up to date and really nice sizeðŸ‘. The down side of it is that when u first turn it on it has a virus and porn but download a cleaning or security app to take it offðŸ™Œ. p
Very nice and works fine p
It didnt. I never received it. In the box was a charger, a plastic case and some earbuds but NO PHONE!!!! No stars for the phone. n
The phone I orders is defected.. n
no n
Very nice phone. I fully recommend it; the only problem was the bad quality of the camera but fixed that with an app and its great. Does work with straighttalk bring your own phone (BYOP) packet. You have to use the att or t-mobile sim cards and you HAVE to call the customer service operators so they can do it. They will tell you its not going to work blah blah blah but it does work I ordered two of this phones and they are working perfectly wih 4G. Only bought one BYOP packet--it comes with three different sim cards so it worked for me so I could activate both phones with one packet. After you activate the service then straight talk sends you a txt so you visit a website link and activate your internet: dont worry its very easy to do.When you first get it remember to remove back cover and remove paper from battery so it wont blink when you are charging it. Its blinking cuz there's something preventing the phone from charging and the phone is telling you that.Read your instructions peopleGood luck with your phone!Thank you. p
its an ok phone. i like the size, but the camera quality is horrible and it is not 4g compatible like it says. it was extremely slow from the moment i opened it and it will not allow me to send text messages n
When I received this it looked in good condition but once I tried to turn it in it didn't work even though I was charging... First time buying this and I don't recomand this item n
This phone is not a good phone! I haven't had this phone a week, and the screen is already trying to go out. I want my money! n
Just got this today and the phone doesn't work. Like I went to charge it and guess what it just blink white screen every time doesn't show it charging and it won't turn on. I spent 80 dollar that I really don't have just to get my friend a gift for late Christmas gift. Now I am out 80 dollars and I can't do anything with it n
nice phone. can not use with net 10 service. was only problem I had with it. If I could of used it with my service it would of been great. p
Because it isn't compatible with straight talk and it says unlocked. I love the size of it but it's S***. Definitely wouldn't recommend. n
Very nice phone, bigger than a iphone 6 only problem was the poor quality of the camera p
NO GOOD.. I ordered it in November been having problems with it since it came. Its full of viruses! It always black out and lockup. Continues to download everything . please people don't east your money on this phone. My boyfriend and I both order them and still had to buy new phones because this phone is no good. I did not want to give this phone a one star. Wish we could get our money back. This phone is/was very stressful to have n
HORRIBLE! n
This phone is no good. It looks nice but no good. I just got my phone and it keep turning off on me. I'm returning it . I'm piss though because can't get refund until after they get it back I need phone n
Hey,i just received the phone today and it will not come on.. All it do is blank .. I even let it charge for a while and it still blank n
I love the phone but it's not letting me download any apps don't wanna have to send it back but it's really not working right for me n
This phone is very bad. I don't know how to send it back to amazon. First it can't get the connection every where. I use it with T-mobile but I am almost all time out of network connection. Second it is always turn off alone. I really hate this phone n
Worst phone I've ever bought, it was super slow and quit working after 2 weeks, do not buy this piece of junk. n
I love how big the phone is but it totally sucks. It's 2g(not 3G) phone. It cuts on an off on you. Very disappointed in this phone. Would NOT recommend this to anyone. n
Just 1 month and it did not work anymore. It restarts for itself. Not recommend n
It sucks so slow n
Nothing n
I like the size of the screen but this phone is very slow especially when you are downloading a app it takes forever. when your going from one screen to back to home page it takes forever I don't know why....what doesn't it play videos it stops half way thru very very slow moving is there anything I can do to make it move faster and it freezes up n
Â I like this 6 " wide screen and it's perfect for watching video and playing games. I usually leave my review after many weeks of using the phone so this post is late.Love the unlocked dual simcard.Pictures quality is decent and clear.cellphone features are great.High resolution.You can use this phone anywhere in the country and you can use this phone outside the country too because it's unlocked.This phone is affordable and it feels like similar to my samsung.The only down side of this phone is that I noticed if you don't use it much the battery won't stay full even you don't use it.But over all this is a great phone for the price and it won't hurt you to buy this and try.Disclamer:I got this phone for free in return to my unbiased review. p
I have to start out by saying that I really like this phone. I love the 6" screen. Once you use a 6" screen, it's really hard to go back smaller. I currently had a 6" when I received this phone however mine was lacking one feature that I need to have available. That's the hotspot tethering feature. In my line of work, I often end up in places that have no wifi. Which tends to make things difficult for me since I have to be on a computer often. This tethering feature allows me to put my computer on the internet when wifi isn't available as long as I have at least one bar of signal. I have tested out and love this feature as much if not more than the screen size. It's really easy to turn on and off as well.The phone has all my needs that I have to use daily already preset in it. Not only that, but the phone is capable of taking screenshots. There are still many phones that don't offer that option. This feature i use at least 50 times a day.I often listen to music and love that YouTube is readily available. On the home screen if the phone, it comes with a built in radio app. The radio app isn't the greatest but how can you complain, after all you have a radio available everyday all day long. The phone also has the Google play store preinstalled which allows you to add other music apps such as Pandora.The Google play store allows you to download games, videos, and all sorts of apps. Many if them are free of charge.I travel a lot in the evening hours and find myself using flashlights often. However, you ever tried opening a door while holding your keys, phone, and flashlight? Ya, it's hard. This phone is preloaded with the torch app which is a flashlight.Pictures is another feature i have to use daily for work, but I also take lots of pictures in my personal life. This has both front and rear facing cameras. The rear has a flash. The phone comes preloaded with a cool app that has special features for editing photos. Including the smart shot and beauty app.Can't forget to mention the clock, calendar, and calculater apps. I often have to rely on my phone as an alarm clock on the road. I have to use a calendar daily to remember all my appointments. The calculator app is also high important as I am constantly dealing with money.This phone comes with dual sim card slots. I love the idea that it can be used anywhere in the world. It's also a unlocked phone so you can put it on almost any carrier. I use a prepaid carrier. Another bonus is that you can put a micro SD card in there to expand the memory.Overall, this phone is a great phone. It actually has suited all the needs I have on a daily basis. The picture and sound quality is good. You can pick up wifi range further than a lot of phones I've had in the past. It comes ready to be used. It's packed securely and the package is discreet. I would recommend this phone. I received this phone free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion. p

'JUNING SMARTPHONE C5Color: GoldSize: 6.0"I been wanting to have a new smartphone that has a bigger screen size compared to what I have right now, so I feel lucky to have this one. It comes with Manual, battery charger/USB, earphone, clear casing that fit so right and not bulky at all. Juning Unlocked Smartphone 6.0 C5 exceeded my expectations, the phone is well made and looks expensive, and so since I love to take selfie's I immediately tried the 'camera front and back, I am impressed! I had low expectations having 2.2 MP camera front and back, I thought the camera quality resolution will be bad and I'll say I am very wrong. The picture quality is decent clear, it takes a good selfies' and 'videos, I super love it, now I can take selfies anywhere I go. There's a plus for me using camera selfie of this phone, because I don't have to download picture editor or camera360 etc., it comes with it! already ready to use, just simple take your selfie, click makeup in the bottom right side of the screen then holla, there yah go, you can now beautify yourself without downloading any apps, that just saved memory storage.''''''What I like also is for 6" smartphone it is very light to carry around, with that said I can now leave my iPad at home and just carry my Juning Smartphone C5 6" with me, because of the size it is like having 2in1, phone and tablet at the same time which is cool. If you have small hand like me' you need to use to hands while using it. ^____^Juning Smartphone 6.0" is unlocked phone so you can use GSM/WCDMA SIM card, it is not compatible for CDMA SIM card so be aware of that before you buy SIM card, it is good for roaming sim card number, I can now use sim card to text and call my family back home in PH.The phone is nice and clear, looks like HD. Phone storage is 4 GB, up to 16 GB, so I slot my memory card for more storage memory. I was thinking buying bigger memory card like 16GB so that I don't have to worry of getting low of memory specially storing my pictures and apps. 'The phone sound is clear, makes me enjoy listening music' '''. In regard of Battery Life, Probably won't last too long if you use it constantly with full brightness, as I experienced the phone was full since 7am in the morning,I go to work using phone, got home 5:30pm and still have battery life, that is without using it too much. It don't really bother me since I have one power bank with me all the time in case I need it. And if you want to stretch the battery life longer, you can always lower down the brightness of the display. I must say if you use too much phone, you may consider buying extra battery or power bank to be with you, Juning also have Power bank portable external battery charger with smart charger technology for affordable price, check that out.'I am using my phone often using Facebook, Instagram, listening music, watching videos and of course taking selfies/pictures, sometimes the app crashed which is natural for me, same to my old phone and even my iPad crashed too, so that's not a problem. Also, sometimes it seems phone freezing or slow down, but not a problem for me anymore, just search Mr. Google what to do, how to make android phone faster and boom problem solved. :) I don't play games right now because I don't have time for that at this moment so I can't rate that part using this phone. Connecting to wifi was fast and easy, downloading some apps with no problem.Overall for the price under $100 with 6" screen, I can't complain! It's not the best phone out there compared to branded expensive smartphone that will cost you $$$$, and with that said without breaking your bank and still have nice 6" smartphone.' Juning Unlocked smartphone 6.0" C5 is perfectly right for me, I already felt like I am having a iPhone 6s.Also, Juning has a great customer service. Thank you Ms Sophie you're one of a kind.Purchased this phone for free except for the shipping and handling, this phone was like for testing in return of my honest review of this product, i am only writing what i experienced, noticed while using this phone.Pictures and video will be uploaded on my next update.'I will update once i noticed something different. p

Phone worked great for two weeks. Started having problems opening and closing Apps, constantly have to press button for apps n
Phone sucks n
Good Phone p
worst phone ever, gets hot while playing games, hesitates and automatically switches to home screen while in other apps., returned pronto!!! n
WAIST OF YOU MONEY DONT BUY IT DONT LET THE LOOKS FOOL YOU !!! IM GETTING MY MONEY BACK n
Very slow and my provider said it is an old phone. I threw it in the trash n
Good phone but where do I buy screen protectors p
Over all the phone was very nice...My friends have Samsung and even they was impressed by this phone.However I took it to Metro and the phone would not recognize the system so I wasn't able to active it.. n
One of the worst phones I have ever had. Apps shut down constantly and phone turns off by itself. Apps always say they need to be force closed. YouTube is very very slow, and shuts down randomly. One of the worst buys I have ever had. n
The size of the phone is great! The bad part is that sometimes the phone freezes and the screen will revert back to the home screen without a button being pressed.Some of the apps do not work like YouTube. It would not download for me. It would be nice if the phone supported 4G LTE. I am undecided on whether I want to keep this phone or upgrade to a cheap 4G supported phone. n
The phone works ok here and overseas but don't have the storage so you can't see email or text message until you delete things so that was a let down n
This phone is terrible. International model runs on 2g (T-Mobile) and the screen went dead a week after receiving it. n
Within a day I returned this phone back to Amazon. Nice screen but that's all. Poor internet service. Only allowed 2G network. Downloads were slow. This phone is good if you only plan to use it for Talk and text. Anything else it's a waste of money. n
Great phone,totally worth it p
I have nothing bad to say.....my phone made it right on time.This is a very huge phone just what I wanted.... And also came with not one but two battery #winning p
Hate this phone had it for one day n
Please you didn't do good at this time by sending me a different phone because the phone is not pad phone and moreover is not up to 6" Inch as I saw before ordering it. No cover like the one I have from you before. I'm now afraid to order from you because you would not send what I request for. Have a good day p
was not what they say good luck getting it to work n
Excelente.! p
There are only a couple problems with the phone.. 1) I can't turn off this extremely loud defining beep that goes off ever 30sec-1min. I tired to get help from the company but they never responded to my emails. The people on the other end of the phone conversation say they can hear it too which leads them to sometimes think its a call coming in on there end. 2) the camera is extremely touchy. You have to have it very still or shots will be blurred.3) internal memory is very low, you can only download a few apps. It reads storage space running low all the time after clearing everything. Other than that its not a bad phone. p
GR8 PHONE!!!! All the benefits of a Samsung w.o the inflated price!! I love the screen size! Its bigger than the note 2/3 guys so it makes the viewing better, but harder to find really cool cases. All in all well worth the lack in accesories for the phone. p
I ended up selling it to my brother. It was HUGE! I knew with a 6 inch screen it would be, but it seemed very bulky. He loves it though! p
The battery goes down to quick, takes a while to recharge....but you do have another one. When taking a pic u cannot breathe or it is blurred. When purchased on line someone got my credit card and purchased an airline ticket overseas and some store purchases. If my bank had not known my purchase status because I am disabled whoever could have used all of my monthly bills. I actually wanted a samsung 4 or notebook but could not purchased financially, everyone be carefully. The microSDHC and SD that most ppl order does not go with this phone, so I got to look for the correct ones because the music I had on my other phones will not work, wish I could have just bought the Samsung 4 or notebook... n
My charger does not work.I would like one that works that's what I paid my money for.The phone works fine. n
PHONE WASN'T WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, NICE LOOKING PHONE BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING, WOULDN'T BUY AGAIN, SENT IT BACK. n
When making calls screen goes black and won't light back up when take away from face to hang up. Auto rotation does not work very well either. Phone isn't very fast and I know it's bot my internet connection I have experimented n
love the size of the phone dont realy know if its 2g or 3g an the network is realy slow an can't ope playstore or watch videos n
Do not buy!!! It's a sturdy phone but it capabilities for connectivity is horrible I bought this because I tried to save 50 but I the end I ended up buying a Blu phone anyway u will not get any data on this phone just spend the extra 50 and get a Blu phone its amazing n
Hey I received my phone today and im with straight talk service but it seem like my phone wasn't working and it hurted me do badly because I really like this phone I was do excited about it I didn't know if I need an another phone or was my sim cards was bad or what but im just really sad agout how it went down I fidnt quiet understand y it had two sim slotd or nothing but I was really confused about it all n
Works great have an ATT Straight talk sim chip and works Great!!!! Just when and if you buy a case make sure you can try it with the phone! bought an note 2 case and phone is to big for it p
It didn't work at all n
just received it today not coming on just blinking and its been charging over 2 hours n
Didn't fit our needs in the rural area where we live. We did send it back and were refunded our money in very promptly. n
Totally horrible. The picture does NOT match the product. This picture shows a cute and up to date phone. The one I received was a generic, fake, and not a good one at that. If I'd had the option, I would have given zero stars. n
Only rating it 5 stars so you can see this thing is junk! Don't waste your money the screen came all kind of messed up. Couldn't see anything on it!!! p
Doesnt work like its suppose to n
it was the worst item in history it didint work. n
HMM n
The phone is very poor. I can't access internet it keeps blocking me. No wifi it keeps rejecting wifi. voice very low i can't here it when am driving. the ear phone are also very low keeps falling out the ears. Screen is very sensitive anything that touches it stops what you are listening to or changes your settings. you close the cover you won't hear anything it will stop. This phone is very poorly made and don't serve my of having a phone. It keeps rejecting my SD cards and it has lost all the information I had saved for the last 2 yrs. I can't get anywhere else. Plz I would to return the phone and get my money back. I rather pay more but get a phone that serves right. Don't buy it plz. Even my 20 yrs old children can't figure it out. n
Love it until the phone stop charging and no its not the battery or charger. Its the phone. Had to buy a whole new phone. Try to take it to repair shop they could not help me. It is better to purchase a whole new phone. n
Don't even think about buying it. Its a piece of failed technology, I wasted my money buying it. Its now in the trash. n
It OK but I thuovit will work better then it do. n
Based on other peoples ratings I bought one, then I found it wasn't as they were positively recommending at all, It took about 48 hours to download just one app. You may try one if you think otherwise n
The phone is like a tablet, I love it. Takes good picture and video. For now, I have not seen any problems or have any issues with it. My friends likes it. p
Phone is nice size but for that price internet is to slow returned it and got blu studio 5.5s n
I bought two of these phones for my husband and myself back in February. It only took a couple of days for his to stop working properly. It went dead one day and after he put it on the Charger it still wouldn't turn back on....then mine broke about a month after my purchase, the busted on it with very minor impact , for example like putting it in my purse and just walking around. With it for a couple of hours.... I continued to use it with a busted screen BC I couldn't afford. Repairs and finally about six months. After my purchases it finally knocked. Off and died too....and what little time it did work it would constantly go dead took hours to charge would die within3 mins and never had a bit of working. Speed....it always ran slow ands would ffreeze up. Final thought, I wasted over 400$ on these. Phones and. I could have gotten better use out of a little toy phone then this phone! Worst phone I have ever seen before and very cheaply made!!! n
I was not happy with the internet was very slow with t mobil service, the ringer volume was too low and the color was very dim n
I got the phone and when I opened the box, there was the phone, charger, and cord, and only one battery. It was supposed to come with two batteries. I wrote the seller and they told me there was one in the phone, but there was not. I asked them to send me another battery like they ad promised, but they refused. instead they said they would refund me $3.00, but I have yet to see that either. n
Best phone for your buck i have to say. Dose every thing i wanted and then some. the 6" screen makes it alot easier to read and type. p
just good, i love it .the screen is just great, graphic is good also..i love everything about it p
This phone is excillent!! first things first.the screen is beautiful, bright, and isnt really pixelated. it has great viewing angles compared to other android phones from a China manufacturer. but beware that if you are epecting to get 3G on T-Mobile's network it only supports EDGE wich is converted to 2.5G which is pretty slow in my opinion. idk about at&t but in a few months i might switch just to see if it supports AT&T' 3G p
I am in love with this phone and so is everyone else who sees this phone. I love the size of the screen and the speed of the WI- Fi. Great phone. p
Great service& great cell phone,yes to having speaker phone,I'll let you know about anything else,fun to have,got to take up space to end it on this,bye p
I would have loved this phone but the charging port at the bottom was broke and had to send it back. n
I bought 2 of these phones for my wife and I and both of us love them every where i go i see people who have Galaxy S3 and 4 asking me where did I get that phone they all want to throw away their for mine love it. p
HEY EVERYBODY! After much gnashing of teeth I found a WONDERFUL power supply from EBAY with a LONG PRONG that is PEFECT!! It isItem: 171730876692 on ebay.com p
So far everything is pretty awesome, my plan does not work with it so I have to go to a way more expensive carrier. I won't know until then just how well this phone serves me. The price was absolutely fabulous and the screen size really is what I was going for without having to pay up with my first born! p
Great phone p
I was expecting a 6" screen and it was 6". Everything else not as expected with this good looking phone. n
When I received this phone, which it took about a month. I got the phone I was excited for how big it is, but after waiting so long to get the phone I couldn't even use it without a sim card. Finally got the sim and found out that the internet doesn't work, which means the google play store doesn't work, which means I cant do anything with this phone but call and text. This sucks because im into apps and the internet. Am I the only one who had this problem????? n
This is an amazing Android phone. Very well-made. The price has been going up and down like a yoyo, though. Two weeks after I ordered it, there was a US$19 drop. The vendor has kindly promised to send an additional battery to make it up. Service from this vendor (lol-buy) is quite good. No complaints here.There is already a very helpful and somewhat long review thread on the orange version. I'll simply touch upon two major issues here:(1) The sim cards: I have tried an AT&T data plan micro-sim (an adapter is needed), booted up the phone and the card is recognized. After entering info in the sim management panel, 3G service is indicated by an H next to the signal bars. No problems answering and calling at all. Then a second sim from another country is tested, also recognized right away; although a field test will have to be deferred until my next overseas trip.(2) The GPS: It actually works well. A Satellite Check app (also included in the Polaris Navigation app) operating in the magnetic mode (for indoor use) picks up 9-12 satellites in a few minutes. It takes only seconds to get a fix outdoors. Google Navigation works flawlessly.On the flip side, the display is no retina display; it is just good enough for general viewing. And some apps don't work - those requiring a magnetic sensor (it does not have one), for example, the compass apps. Not deal breakers, of course.Overall, for the money, this is a surprisingly good smartphone. Some tweaking is needed, but it is part of the fun.5/13/2013 Update: (1) The vendor quickly sent over the battery. (2) After many tries, this phone simply cannot be rooted.6/4/2013 Update: This phone actually can be rooted. Now it is perfect!7/19/2013: After almost 3 months of daily use, this phone is still going strong. There has been a huge improvement, thanks to Google. The newest Google Maps no longer stays in RAM thus avoiding the previous version's eating up the memory.8/15/2013: After inserting a new battery, all of a sudden, the phone begins to randomly shut down, does not wake up from sleep, cannot fully reboot, and worse, the battery cannot be re-charged. Turns out to be a contact issue: the three copper pins on the battery and the phone sometimes do not kiss tightly. The battery needs to be about 0.1-0.2mm longer. A spacer made from aluminum foil corrects the problems. These symptoms are suspiciously similar to some previous comments complaining about a broken phone or unchargeable battery. Probably just a loose connection.3/3/2014: After testing umpteen apps. Two prove the most useful: (1) a browser with a funny name "Naked Browser" allows automatic deletion of history, cache, etc, on exit; and (2) MobileUncle is a must, in its Engineering -> localization mode, a GPS fix can be obtained in less than 18 sec. Others such as Documents-to-Go works well with Dropbox and phone calls, both US and international, with Viber is a breeze. This dual core phone still does a good job, it'll be interesting to see if the ones with octacore will now take over. p
I have family mobile prepaid sim card and it worked right away the phone gets good signal and its works great.. The phone is not real fast but its fast enough and everything works fine.. For this price it is not bad at all. p
WOW. WHERE DO I START, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS PHONE, HUGE SCREEN FOR US HARD TO SEE FOLKS, THAT OUR EYES ARE AGING. WORKS WELL, WITH SIMS, FROM STAIGHT TALK, T_MOBILE, AT&T, SO IF YOU HAVE THE AS YOUR PREPAID CARRIER IT WORKS WELL WITH THEM, THE T-MOBILE ON WORKS A LITTLE SLOWER, AND INTERNET IS SLOW, BUT ALL IN ALL NOT T BAD, UNLESS THERE ARE NO TOWERS T-MOBILE WORKS OFF OF THE SERVICE AND BE TERRIBLE ALOT OF BREAKING AND DROPPED CALLS., BUT THERE ARE MORE PROS THAN CONS, SO I WOULD RECOMMENDTHIS PRODUCT.. p
Only had it for 5 minutes it stop working the screen went out. Really loved this phone but I really want my money back n
This phone doesn't work good at all! It keeps shutting off and hanging up on people. Worst phone ever!!!! n
I love this phone! It took the place of my mega and looks and feels better toooo!!!!!!! p
thanks n
Really nice phone and really big also but the only down side is that is is really slow. p
What's I expected ðŸ‘ thanks. Love it p
I did not have this phone 3 months. It started freezing up and turning off and on by itself. I had to order another phone. n
I just got mine today and I gotta say its more than I expected....no glitches so far. Can't stop playing on it!Does anybody know what case I could buy to fit it? p
The phone works ok here and overseas but don't have the storage so you can't see email or text message until you delete things so that was a let down n
This phone is terrible. International model runs on 2g (T-Mobile) and the screen went dead a week after receiving it. n
I LOVE THE WAY THE PHONE LOOKS BUT MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THE INTERNET SERVICE, ITS SLOOOOW! I CANT EVEN DOWNLOAD ANY APPS BECAUSE THE MARKET WONT LOAD.. n
At first i hated the phone because i put my sim card in & it wouldnt read it .it took me about a week with this phone to figure out my sim card was in backwards. *face palm* Other than that ive had no problems , ive read all the other bad reviews & i was a little worried to get this phone but their was more good reviews than bad. i than got it . everyone asks where i got the phone and always say how big it is & how they like it. Its pretty fast i get signal everywhere. the only thing is if you use straight talk you cant recieve pics. their apn doesnt unlock pics.. but on the plus side i didn't realize when i bought it you can take screen shots when holding down the volume button & the power button at the same time.everything works great . im glad i got this phone its a good deal for the price p
i love the phone works very well. BUT now the pixals are messing up and i never drop the phone it does it very randomly also the ear peice is very low but other then that the phone is love n
Some things were good about this phone but some things were not. When scrolling it would be blurry till you stopped. Hurt the eyes. Too many weird things would pop up too that was not on my phone. n
The phone looks great but the charger went out my battery never stayes charged. The headphones it came with was poor quality the charger also because it went out/stopped working. The size of the phone is great n
i bought this phone and when i first got it i had problems with hanging the phone up. When you call somebody the screen will go off so when you are done talking to them you have to wait on them to hang up. Also recently my volume went out i cant hear text messages or calls, and when people call me they can hear me but i am stuck saying HELLO, because i cant hear anything and i only had this phone a little over a month and now my return policy is out of date. Now that's money gone to waist and i have to try to save money to get an new phone. n
The phone ring volume is so low even on high and there are no case to fit phone pad wow wat a waist should have stayed with boost mobile never received charger to pad n
loved the phone. I've had it a month and last night it just turned off. will not turn back on or charge. very upset. n
GR8 PHONE!!!! All the benefits of a Samsung w.o the inflated price!! I love the screen size! Its bigger than the note 2/3 guys so it makes the viewing better, but harder to find really cool cases. All in all well worth the lack in accesories for the phone. p

Great phone,totally worth it p
I have nothing bad to say.....my phone made it right on time.This is a very huge phone just what I wanted.... And also came with not one but two battery #winning p
Hate this phone had it for one day n
Please you didn't do good at this time by sending me a different phone because the phone is not pad phone and moreover is not up to 6" Inch as I saw before ordering it.

was not what they say good luck getting it to work n
Excelente.! p
There are only a couple problems with the phone.. 1) I can't turn off this extremely loud defining beep that goes off ever 30sec-1min. I tired to get help from the company but they never responded to my emails. The people on the other end of the phone conversation say they can hear it too which leads them to sometimes think its a call coming in on there end. 2) the camera is extremely touchy. You have to have it very still or shots will be blurred.3) internal memory is very low, you can only download a few apps. It reads storage space running low all the time after clearing everything. Other than that its not a bad phone. p
Everything was fine until three week ago I turn my phone on and it was totally wacked up I've had the phone only six months I will not buy another one will be sticking with American made only n
Excelente p

Its a very nice item to have and is good for the children to use as well, thanks! p
It's my first tablet (phablet) and it is little old, slow. But, I can always learn and find a use for it. Price was right. I haven't activated the phone yet, it's a GMS network phone and I'm still exploring providers. Somebody told me SEARS sold this make and model. It might be acting slow because the mobile data isn't activated yet. Happy. p
it is ok. p
Nicee p
i received the product...came with an international charger so therefore i was not able to use it and i sent it back. n
The Internet is to slow, when I used the cell I have to use the headphones and one of the headphones doesn't work. n
Terrible because the headlines said that it was unlocked but when I received my shipment of the product to get it turned on it was locked so I'm sending it back n
its ok for kids I have to keep on takeing off the battery cover to reset the phone n
Like this because of the dual sim but I can't get rid of the apps that keep popping up in Chinese real annoying and it is very s?ow when surfing the web n
I'm an apple guy like i phone or ipad, but i think i would be better off to stay away from any cheap tablets. n
The phone I received was actually in better shape than described. When I took the phone in to switch it over, the associate was extremely impressed with what I paid, and said that the phone was new. Thank you for having such high standards. The phone is working perfectly, and I love it. What a deal! p
This phone is advertised as a US Cellular phone, however it's software had only been hacked and not compatible with their network nor could it be activated. n
Got verison was suppose to be At@t. n
Product came like it was described. p
I got it and the space bar won't work. Not happy. n
This phone was perfect. Took it to US Cellular and had no problem at all activating it. My son-in-law loves it. Even the US Cellular reps were impressed with the NEW condition and the price!! They also said BlackBerrys can be slow but this one seems very fast. p
because l lost my money. this phone (CDMA) can not be operated in venezuela. (movilnet, movistar y digitel). its not work. n
I recevied the phone with broken trackball, missing micro-sd and missing battery.The seller claimed that it is 100% working. i cannot see how such a phone can be workingwithout the internal sd and battery. It claimed that it is OEM and brand new.My obervations indicated this was a poorly attempted refurbished phone. They must berunnin out of second handed parts. n
I disliked this phone so much as to purchase a Samsung unit. It would turn off the radio function by itself, I missed many calls as the ringer might or might not work. The only thing I could get on the web was the weather channel. n
I ordered this phone for my nephew and its ok for him, but not for me. It freezes up from time to time. n
I'm very pleased with this phone.I haven't had any issues with it since I've had it.delivery was good it got here before the estimated date which is good.its alittle slow but that's all. Overall its a good phone at least for me. p
I didnt end up using it, but its cute and im sure ill find a use somewhere down the read p
Fast, simple and easy. p
Hilarious. Worked great for Zack Morris Halloween costume p
Perfect for a Zack Morris costume! Everyone loved it! p
It was awesome and fun p
Although super cute and fun, the item I received tends to leak air very slowly when blown up. n
good p
Fantastic product. p
The camera is big disappointment on many levels.The stock Android version of Acer is not smooth not its user friendly.The hardware and performance is not even as fast as the old Samsung Galaxy SIII.The bottom buttons are not illuminating, and not sensitive enough for your touch (hit them at least twice).The bottom line is: do NOT buy this phone unless you desperately need a tri-sim phone with no useful smartphone features. n
The description says 16GB rom, it only has 8GB rom. I am very disappointed at the erroneous and misleading description. n
I had high hopes for this Acer phone based their reputation for laptops etc. It is a very well designed phone and it's well made but badly let down by two things.The Android operating is stuck at 4.4 with no hope of an update. The front (selfie) cÃ¢mera which is supposed to be 5 MP is actually about a tenth of that (maybe .5) and very grainy. I checked twice to see if there was perhaps a plastic protective sheet covering the lens, but nothing.Asides from that, the phone works well and has clear calls, a nice screen and fast internet.The battery life is not enough, but all smartphones are the same in that area. I have become accustomed to carrying around a battery pack.All in all, a nice phone let down by the totally unacceptable front camera and out-of-date operating system. Its going back! n

this phone was a replacement for my niece, hers broke down. The shipping was fast. It took her a while to get use to the windows phone, in the beginning she complain a lot. And she was right because the display isn't that big, the rim is about 1 inch and if you use to work with a full display the bottom is annoying and the speaker didn't work that well (the other side couldn't hear you clearly) I think it was a glitch of windows 8.1. But overall it a good phone for my niece because she's broke two expensive smart phone. So this one is just right price for a teenager like her. Till now this phone with stand her rudeness and carelessly. n
Dual Sims are better than one sim has blurred data! p
Nice phone. I am waiting to be upgraded to Windows 10 p
I did not receive my order items. n
First off, great service as usual. I wanted a small Windows Phone and had seen this phone at the MS store. I liked the look, and thought it would work. First off, there are no directions for inserting the SIM card. Why would you need directions you ask? Because after ten minutes of dinking with it I realized that SIM1 on this phone is a "full-size" SIM card! Who has those anymore? So, I had to put my SIM card in the SIM2 slot. When I did that, every call I made required me to select SIM2 over SIM1. Also, it was taking way to long for all my apps to load. Ridiculously too long. But the nail in the coffin for this phone was the screen. It's awful. You have to tilt the phone just right to see the screen clearly. Just a little angle from any direction and it like your looking through one of those PC security screens from the 80's. One other reason I was interested in the phone was the textured case; I thought it would be easier to grip. Not. It's slipperier than the smooth case on my Lumina 635, which I'd use all the time if it had a front facing camera. Anyway, if any on you know of a good Windows phone with a 4" screen I'd appreciate your feedback. n
Excelente Producto p
Item is good. The only thing is AT&T does will no longer provide 2G network service p
It's work well p

My 14 year old bought this with his babysitting money, not for a phone, but as a mini-computer with a texting app to text his friends (from wi-fi, as he has no data for it). He really likes it. The only regret is that he knew ahead of time it was a Windows system but now wishes it was an android. This is not the fault of the company--he knew when he bought it. Overall, he likes it. p
The phones were advertised as being "Windows 10 Ready", this couldn't be farther from the truth. The minute we tried to download Windows 10 we received an error message saying that it was not possible to do on that phone. We promptly sent them back. n
excellent p
phone very poor quality. I recommend not to buy n
It'sn a powerfull phone. n
nice phone i like it p
This is the best budget phone you can get in my honest opinion, it has it all, a Quad-core processor, 2gb Ram, 16gb ROM, good looking, it feels good in your hand.the camera is not the greatest but, is pretty good for this price.The software run pretty smoothly and fast, I've installed a lot of apps with no problems at all.The only downside is the battery life, but it's not a big deal. p

This phone settings were in a different language I thinkwas like Chinese; however after playing with it I found the tools in the settings and I was able to change it to English. the phone seems very nice and it's a really good phone for the price. It is good to mentioned it only took me about 10 minutes to be able to change it to English. p
High quality phone, ultra portable, impact resistant, incredibly long lasting battery, loud clear calls. Simple yet very effective. p
I love this phone. I like it better than my old iPhone. Much thinner and once you learn Android system, easier to use. A great buy! p
This phone seems pretty excellent for the money. Only had it 2 days, and set it up with Tracfone (who are clueless and it was a nightmare) but now that that is done it seems great. It could die in a week, but so far, so great!Update: had a problem with an SD card, but it seems the card itself was the problem. This phone does the job. Its not an iPhone, but it also hasn't got the pricetag. It does what I need and is reliable. Wifi works well. Great value. p

Great phone for the price and the headset is a great perk. Both work fantastic no problems p
CONNECTION ON PHONE CALLS IS TERRIBLE, DOES NOT KEEP TRACK OF CALLS WITH DUAL SIMS, DOES NOT ALWAYS SCREEN MIRROR.... MANY MANY ISSUES n
BUY A CASE, BUY A CASE BUY A CASE! every revier and unboxing I saw when this phone came out showed one included - WRONG. The phone is awesome but more slippery than a fish. Had is less than a week and both sides cracked while in my FSfjxrhdyxING pocket......... p
Nice phone, fast but it heat up very quick and cool down quick too. p
Easily the best phone I've ever used. Great price point but even better performance and image quality of the screen and sound quality from speakers. Will stick with this phone for a while unless Alcatel can somehow find a way to out do the Idol 4s. p
thank u alcatel i love it p
UPDATED....After 1 month....this is still a great phone. This is replacing my Galaxy S5. I also have an iPhone 6 which I use for work. I have also used the HTC ONE X+, HTC M9, LG G3, Moto G3 and Honor 5X. The Idol 4S is a great phone, it is very thin and has a beautiful build. Battery life has been great....easily 12+ hours, waaaaaay longer if you're not killing it with games all day. Stand by/idol time is amazing. Total "screen on time" for me is around 4-1/2 hours with checking emails, texting, you tube, reading news, music, some casual gaming (examples: SSG3, SkyForce reloaded, Words, Fieldrunners 2, Smash Hit, Defense Zone 3) for a total of 12+ hours use. It also recharges very fast. The display is AWESOME...even outside in the sun is no problem. Better than all of the above mentioned phones. Not sure if the screen is gorilla glass...I have no scratches yet and I don't use a screen protector. I've watched many reviews of this phone before buying. Most of them complain about the fingerprint scanner. There is really nothing wrong with it. It is very comparable in speed to my iPhone 6 and registers the same number of times....about 98% of the time. I actually think its a little better than the iPhone 6 fingerprint scanner. The sound is awesome on this phone whether you use headphones or not. I have not had any issues with AT&T cell signal, GPS, or bluetooth. No problem with bluetooth connecting to my car or my home A/V receiver. I ALWAYS use Nova Launcher on every Android phone in my family, and the Idol 4S is no exception. This phone with the 652 processor and 3 gig ram handles everything easily. The phone runs super smooth...no lagging. And this phone comes with decent JBL headphones, screen protector, and VR headset (VR is pretty cool). Overall a great buy but I think $350 might be a better price. It's a definite buy either way. You will not be disappointed. p
Coming from an Asus Zenfone 2, this smartphone charges super fast. The screen is super crisp vibrant colors and with a VR, JBL headphones and a faux tempered screen protector can't go wrong with the package on this phone. p
I broke my Iphone 6 plus and I was not willing to pay $750+++ for a new Apple phone. I have to admit I was a little leery of this phone given the fact that I am a long time Apple user. After some careful research I decided on the Alcatel IDOL 4S. It is much more affordable and still delivers the high end experience I was looking for. So far I am extremely happy with the purchase and would highly recommend anyone to give this phone a shot. In terms of speed my IDOL 4S is noticeably faster on the web in the same environment as my Iphone 6 plus. In terms of battery I could barely get through half a day on my Iphone with heavy use. My IDOL 4S ends the day with between 30% and 40% of power left with the same kind of usage. When you do need to charge it has some technology that charges the phone super fast called â€œquick charge 2.0â€. I take a ton of pictures with my phone and I love the fact that this phone offers a flash on the front and rear sides of the phone. The ability to expand the memory on the phone with a micro SD card is a huge plus to me because I keep so many pictures on my phone. I rarely listen to music through my phone's internal speakers, however this phone has two speakers on it! (One on the top of the phone and one on the bottom.) I compared it to my iphone and it's a huge difference. You get a surround sound affect and it is much louder than any of my other phones. I haven't tried out the VR googles yet, but the JBL headphones that come with it are surprisingly good quality. Alcatel also throws in a screen protector, making this phone a complete package. I am an AT&T customer and they have an app called "AT&T mobile transfer" that literally takes minutes to transfer all your contacts, videos, and pictures from your original device to your new device. So easy to use and it doesn't matter if you are going from Apple to Android based. 5 stars across the board, VERY satisfied customer! p
This device is fire '. It's nice from its nice battery life to its camera. Its VR goggles is OK nothing that will blow you a way. Its worth its price from screen to design. p

I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time. n
The phone hangs up after I speak for five minutes. I've only had it less than 6 months. I would not recommend. n
very good product, I recommend p

Works great p
great phone for # gave it to my relative in philippines works perfect there p
My teenage son was very excited about getting this phone only to be disappointed after only a couple months of having it. The screen blanks out on occasion, the battery is already dying despite him charging it properly, and he sadly still likes my droid turbo better because it can do more. Otherwise, he loves having his own phone. n
It's a cellphone locked locked ... for metrospc n
The Alcatel phone is nice but they are cheaply made, that's why they are so inexpensive. The prongs inside the phone where you plug in the charging cable are cheaply made and tend to bend and break. The volume on the phone leaves a lot to be desired. The phone lasted about 6 months. n
good p
Phone was not unlocked as advertized. n
The phone is great , very fast, good sharpness , good sound , pretty pictures , and works very well with Movistar p
Even though I got a phone with a weak batt. and just ordered another batt., the seller "Emily's store" did contact me after my 3 star review and offered to pay for my new batt., I will decline, but because of that customer service/concern I would have to move it to 5 stars, it seems they will initiate and try to rectify a problem......I am a happy customer. Dave p
Not FACTORY unlocked!!!Metro PCS phone. After 2 two days of my time and internet searching the phone is now usable after properly unlocking and rooting.Phone comes with Metro PCS bloatware (unneeded useless junk) installed. Factory unlocked phones do not come on with the message "Metro PCS riding on the nationwide T-Mobile network" .I repeat NOT A FACTORY UNLOCKED PHONE.At my pay rate the company who sold this should give a refund X's 3! n
Fantastic product, I purchased the unit for my son. p
Happy with this phone.works well with T-Mobile. Its value for money. p
The cell is blocked, I LIVE In Dominican RepÃºblic And SAY Sim Invalid n
Bought this to use in Mexico, works great, fully functional. p
will have to buy a second one, its great. p
good. p
I don't think it is a factory unlock phone anytime when I turn on the phone show metro pcs n
Great phone for the price! Fast shipping, and worked wonderfully out of the box. You can't beat this phone for what it costs- does everything a high end phone does and is a nice size screen. p
i have recived the smartphone in venezuela and it does not factory unlocked, only works with MOVISTAR/TELEFONICA. n
excellent product received in time recommend p
incdredible phone like the S3 or S4 mini its so fast and handle p
excellent p
very good, excellent p
Awesome would recomend p
A really great phone... Works perfectly... Thank you for tour help p
muy bueno p
The phone appears to be decent. Still trying to get this so called unlocked phone to work on my carrier.I have learned quite allot buying an unlocked phone. The phone i bought was a T Mobile phone, I can only get it to work on T Mobile towers. There coverage sucks. My Carrier is straight talk, I can't get the APN settings to change to Straight talk. My advice just buy the phone from the carrier you use. The seller of this phone best Tech express has poor customer service!!!! p
Great phone it has a lot of features I just love it p
I give it a 4 star rating only because of the issue with the microphone and not seeing the 4G icon when in a 4G Network... Other than that, it's an awesome upgrade from the Alcatel One Touch Fierce. p
Perfect,except you need sd card from day one .the internal memory is low. p
Put in a Tmobile chip and only the phone worked no data. Since it was a metro pcs phone I went there and they couldn't activate it.. and they have the phone for $29.00... so it went in my pile of junk n
Thank You p
Love it. Nice large screen, very fast shipping and customer service as well. p
The phone looks nice, but it was not unlocked as described. so i had to spend another $20 to unlocked it. n
I love it , it's very fast and great and also is ensured that this unlocked p
Excellent, the phone work very well ,. i live in Santo Domingo and i'm very happy with this buy , it's true the phone is FACTORY UNLOCKED - WORKS WITH ANY SIM CARDS p
The phone met my expectations but I just wished it had more storage n
good p
Item came exactly as described and works well. p
very good cellphone! p
fine beatufull p
Not it for my husband as a replacement phone. We have tmobile as out carrier and it was easier than i thought! We just slipped in the sun SIM card and we were making calls! Comes in original packaging and was professionally labeled that it had been opened just for unlocking. The phone still had it's original screen protestant packing. Very satisfied with this purchase especially at the price! p
Genial. Puntuales y responsables. p
The Alcatel Fierce 2 is nice phone since I am using this phone for more that an year. Sound quality is pretty good also the hands free speaker. Sensitivity of the touch screen also very good. 4GB memory is good enough to multitask and installing many apps if needed. The only think I didn't like is the thickness of the phone. p
Bought this supposedly unlocked phone for use when I travel to the Caribbean. Discovered today that it was "bricked up" by T-Mobile. The following error message appeared on a black screen:"Security Error:This phone has been flashed with unauthorized software & is locked. Call your mobile operator for additional support. Please note that repair/return for this issue may have additional cost."So, I am stuck with a useless phone and $109 poorer. n
Ok 4 the price but if you're used to better phones like LG, Samsung, or HTC it's gonna be crappy.But it works and doesn't lag or anything. And isn't to shabby on speed either. Camera is garbage. Audio playback is actually good. Screen nice n clear. n
Bought a used Alcatel OneTouch Fierce 2. Arrived in 2 shipping days! Looks brand new, works perfect! I had the Onetouch I originally but it broke; this truly lives up to be called the OneTouch's predecessor! Both outperform many of the more famous (ex Galaxy, IPhone) and expensive phones, for a MUCH lower price! A must for any traveling person who relies on phone! (flashlight, compass, GPS, texting, internet, APP support, and good CPU/RAM)!! Thank you 5* p
This phone stop working after one mount this product is defective n
Does not ring already and the speaker stopped working! And my pictures just keep being deleted. I can no longer send pictures in a text. All of my contacts are gone. It is junk! Don't buy it! n
Not bring charger and charging pin is wrong, not me guato this article n
Phone says unlocked and it's not, had to order another phone n
Is a good cell for the price p
Why cant my t mobile sim card fit inside the sim slot. It says this phone is also inside a t mobile phone but that was a lie or maybe there are different types of t mobile sim cards, i don't know, but mines do not fit. n
Satisfied p
the phone has problems to activate n
Restarts or shuts down on it's own several time a day. Takes about 5 minutes to start up after this. Can freeze and restart while doing something. Google maps never worked for more than 5 minutes before closing. Doesn't deserve even a single star. Total waste of money, plain junk. n
Excelente p
excellent p
I loved youit is juat I need p
excellent p
Phone was not unlocked when I received it even though it was advertised as unlocked. Phone did not work so I also had to have it repaired. . Bad choice by me to buy this phone from this vendor. n
it has become difficult to release me because in Venezuela takes no line n
I liked the phone but I phone signal disappointed because I expected to have a signal 4g in Venezuela because several friends have the same cell and if the signal rises 4g but not mine. the seller treated me well and I sent the code to unlock the phone p
Would be 5 Stars except its a T Mobile phone, seller needs to clarify this, other than that the phone is a very good deal for the price. Pictures quality for the price is good, easy to set up and operate. Has a lot of apps that are useful , call quality is good.Overall you cant be the price , If you looking for an inexpensive this one will work well for you, I use Straight Talk and had no problems setting this phone up and its worked beyond expectations based on some of the reviews. You will need to cut down your Standard SIM card for this phone p
EXCELENT p
Good p
I bought many phones of this model for friends and for my use. All of them were working perfect at the first months. Couple of months later problems came with them. Mine one used to restart during phone conversations. Contact and other applicaions give error and I have to close them. Alarm mode does not works. If I try a phone call it takes long to beep or dialing. Not factory unlocked to uninstall app not needed. I had the first model and GPS works great, this one not. So I would not recomend this model. The big problem looks like to be a model manufactured exclusively for T-Mobil and Metro PCS. If they are used out from USA there are not posibilities to update when updates are available. I have done root and any how the same problem with update. My last problem at the time. n
The phone hangs up after I speak for five minutes. I've only had it less than 6 months. I would not recommend. n
very good product, I recommend p

Works great p
great phone for # gave it to my relative in philippines works perfect there p
My teenage son was very excited about getting this phone only to be disappointed after only a couple months of having it. The screen blanks out on occasion, the battery is already dying despite him charging it properly, and he sadly still likes my droid turbo better because it can do more. Otherwise, he loves having his own phone. n
It's a cellphone locked locked ... for metrospc n
The Alcatel phone is nice but they are cheaply made, that's why they are so inexpensive. The prongs inside the phone where you plug in the charging cable are cheaply made and tend to bend and break. The volume on the phone leaves a lot to be desired. The phone lasted about 6 months. n
good p
very easy to use, clean design and the camera is great :) A+++ fast shipping!!! p
Review after 4 days:Pro:-Speakers are bananas-Pulling down the top bar shows a quick preview. Pull down again to show more settings.-Speakers on both sides (on top and bottom).-Battery is fantastic upon buying (great once you start downloading apps). Usually, l phones drain at an average rate and then at 20% it magically drops to 0 in no time. This drains slowly without magical drops even when I have WiFi on and using Spotify and pinterest at the same time at 4%. Good stuff.-Less bloatware: Avg antivirus, Facebook, twitter, chrome, drive, google+, hangouts, weather, WiFi transfer, adobe reader, (NFC) tags, radio, WiFi display, YouTube.-Design of app buttons - not outdated looking.-Pros say the display is meh but it looks good to me.-Double tap screen to wake up. Good if laying flat so you don't have to pick up to press power button.-Don't need to sign in password to access basic pull down settings.-If your phone dies, all the apps open when you turn on, like a computer. Nice-You can uninstall factory apps that are not run by Google. Deleted FB and Twitter, but can't delete YouTube. (Almost) for the win.Meh:-Music: songs overlap 5 secs so you know what song is next.-Camera is acceptable.-Option to pick up in any orientation. I don't need this feature but if your oober lazy/clumsy I guess this could work for you.-Power button is on left and volume is on right. Weird but okay.-Quick access to certain buttons when wake up from sleep like camera, messages, etc.Con:-UI is not intuitive like Apple/Samsung.-Lacks a lot of settings options. No universal settings button like on Samsung.-There's no main home page like on Samsung; when you press the home button, it goes to the last page you were on.-Design of buttons: instead of a backwards play button for 'go back' it is an upside down triangle. Home is a circle instead of a house. Showing all open apps is a square. As a designer, this bugs me because they have no correlation...unless they do corrolate in China.-A sealed battery.-Bottom button bar takes up far too much space and makes screen smaller.-Have to tap each text to the time stamp.-About 4 hrs after unboxing, checked music settings and pressing a song to play in library, it often skips over that song. Sometimes over 1, sometimes as much as six. O thought maybe it was the file type but if you press the backward button (next to pause, not the main), or select play next in queue and press fast forward, it will play. Annoying. Hopefully putting the songs I want into playlists will solve this, unless it skips those too.All in all, acceptable for under $200 compared to iPhone and samsung. I mean really, we are all spoiled. All you really need is call, text, and camera. Use a tablet or computer for all the app bull. Would still rather my SG-S4 because of the user interface, but I get what I need here. (My S4 just up and died on me. Won't turn on. Survived for 3 wks without it) p
I know this may sound funny to many people, but this phone reminds me a lot of iPhone 6. They both have similar dimension and the same screen size. The Idol 3's build quality is very good and it just doesn't feel like a budget phone. I absolutely love the screen for its resolution and color. This came from someone who have used LG G4 and Motorola Moto X and Moto G. This phone is not the fastest out there but it is smooth enough for every day use. I didn't experience any delay so far unlike BLU Life One 4G LTE (2015) which I returned for sluggish performance. I would recommend Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 4.7" to anyone who doesn't like all those huge 5.5" phones out there but rather has a small easy to handle phone. p
Lasted less than a month.I went to sleep one night with the phone on the included USB charger. When I woke up, I noticed it was glitching very badly between my PIN lock screen and the home screen dashboard. My touches did not register. I couldn't even make it go into a hard reset.Fast forward one hour later -- it had stopped holding a charge. The phone died pretty hard and at a time I was least expecting it.Fast forward some more -- I attempt to RMA the phone. Their website isn't very intuitive when it comes to finding a repair center. Eventually I find their US repair center. I start filling out the forms, but then I realized I couldn't grab my phone's IMEI and chalked it up as a $175+ loss. Fortunately I have the budget to grab a new phone, but that's still a lot of money to spend on a phone just to have it stop working after a month of moderate use.It's a shame, because for the price, it's a snappy little phone. I liked their UI, and it was fairly close to stock Android. Way better than anything with Touchwiz shoved on it, that's for sure. The camera wasn't that great, but I was willing to live with that. I may grab another one just because I liked the UI so much, but I am going to be very weary and much more proactive about keeping the proper warranty info.Maybe it would just be worth getting a Moto G instead. n
Exceptional phone for the price. Lightweight, thin, bright screen. loud and clear speakers front speakers. Process is reasonably responsive. Works with your Google voice number, unlike Asus Zenfone 2. p
This phone is great for anyone looking for an inexpensive, yet high performing, smartphone. p
Pros-Smooth Performance-All Day Battery Life-Excellent Build Quality-Good Quality Screen-NFC (Android Pay Compatible)-Decent Camera-MicroSD ExpansionCons-Awkward Button Placement-Squeaky Vibrating Motor-Updates not guaranteed-No Gorilla GlassShould you buy: YESActual Value: $220I loved my Moto G. It made me always question why people spend over $600 on phones when a $200 could work just as well. With the new Moto G, I was willing to buy it right on the spot. But what turned me off was the nearly 3 weeks Iâ€™d have to wait for one to be delivered. So I started my search for the next best phone under $200, which lead me to this phone. Iâ€™ve had some experience with Alcatel phones, so I didnâ€™t have much expectations with this phone. That being said, Iâ€™ve had a couple of days with it and I can say with absolute confidence that I love it.-Design-This is one light phone. Iâ€™m starting with that because you have no idea how light it is until you hold it in your hand. I actually thought for a moment that the battery wasnâ€™t inside it yet. But it is pleasant to hold in the hand. The design is all plastic, so donâ€™t expect anything premium on this phone like metal. But it is solidly built, rivaling even the Galaxy S5 in build quality. Speaking of which, this phone is lighter and slimmer than the S5. If the phone were sold for more money, Iâ€™d still be satisfied. Itâ€™s not just good build quality for the price. Itâ€™s excellent build quality. Period. The chrome accent is a nice touch and the speaker grills are slightly angled towards the phone, which add a bit of sparkle to an otherwise black phone. No soft touch plastic on this phone, but it does land on a middle ground where the plastic is nice to touch and is resistant to fingerprints. The design is completely symmetrical, which is important for a certain feature that is unique to it. Iâ€™d love it even more if it were available in a different color such as white, but that is personal preference. Overall, I canâ€™t find much to complain; especially for the low $180 price.-Performance-If you have seen the Moto Gâ€™s specs, youâ€™re pretty much getting the same hardware. It uses a Snapdragon 410, 720p display, microSD expansion, Android Lollipop, and even the same camera module (Sony IMX 214). However, there are a few key difference that make this a better phone than the Moto G. For instance, this phone has 1.5 GB of RAM (Moto G=1GB), actual front facing stereo speakers, a 4.7â€ compared to the 5â€, NFC, and 16GB of storage(Moto G=1GB). In benchmarks, I have gotten similar results to the Moto G in both CPU and graphic performance. But benchmarks are only one side of the performance experience. The other is daily user experience. Based on the couple of days with it and after installing many apps, I can tell you that this phone is snappy. Itâ€™s not as fast as the current flagship lineup, but it never lags or clips the graphics. Apps open relatively quickly and the animations are smooth, as well as the transitions from one app to another. In my testing of multitasking ability, it opened Chrome, Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and YouTube with no lag and each app open where I left them off. Opening more will force the phone to suspend one of those apps to save RAM, but 4 apps at once without closing is pretty good for the cost. Games also perform good, as long as you have reasonable expectations. 2D games such as Angry Birds, Pokemon Puzzle, and Clash of Clans run smoothly and without an issue. Other games like Asphalt 8 and Real Racing 3 will run smooth, but not at the highest quality setting. But thatâ€™s to be expected from a midrange phone. Signal quality is good. I was able to get 62 Mbps download speed and 8 Mbps upload on T-Mobileâ€™s 4G LTE around Pasadena, CA. Thanks to band 12 support, cell signal in buildings is good with the signal almost never going under 3 bars. The speakers are also amazingly good and loud, coming close to matching HTCâ€™s Boomsound phone speakers thanks to the help from JBL. Overall, it performs close to flagship specs, albeit a bit slower. Most people should be happy with this phone.-Display-The phone itself has a beautiful HD display with a 312 PPI (note that the iPhone 6 has a 324 PPI) and it is advertise as being calibrated by Technicolor. While they arenâ€™t at the S6â€™s quality display, it does come close. The display has a nice color calibration, with vivid colors and nice blacks and whites. It is also bright enough for using even in direct sunlight and the good contrast means you can clearly see what you are doing. It isnâ€™t perfect since there are a couple of issues. The colors do have a VERY slight cool tone, meaning that the whites do have a TINY bit of blue to them. Another small issue is that there is a slight amount of light bleed on one side of the displace. But it isnâ€™t noticeable in daily use and it is good for the price of the phone. One crucial one is the fact that they arenâ€™t using Gorilla glass on this display, opting for the more discreet Dragontrail Glass. Since this is going to be my daily driver, I didnâ€™t want to test the toughness (if Alcatel provides me a unit, Iâ€™d gladly test it) but Iâ€™ve looked into it and it trades scratch resistance for toughness. It might be easier to scratch it, but it is more resistant to shock. Only time will tell and I will update this review as time moves on.-Camera-The camera is a back-facing 13 MP camera and a front, wide angle 5 MP camera. The rear camera uses a Sony Exmor IMX 214, which is the same unit found in the new Moto G and the more expensive Nexus 6. The results are mixed though. On one side, outdoor pictures are good. Whenever there is good lighting such as outside or a well lit room, the pictures do come out high quality with colors mostly accurate and the camera absorbing a lot of details. However, during the night, the picture quality takes a hit, with the camera struggling to get any details from the lack of light. It will get some details if they is ANY type of light, but not much. The lack of OIS also contributes to this issue, but there is no phone with OIS at this price range at the moment. The flash is okay, but since it isnâ€™t a dual tone unit, the light tends to overflow and photos tend to lose their details. Videos are also a similar story, with good lighting providing good results and the opposite being true. There is EIS, but the effect isnâ€™t that noticeable and it doesnâ€™t really help with the quality. This isnâ€™t a camera youâ€™re going to use for important, memorable moments. But for things that most people use, like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it works great. This is especially true for the front facing camera, with the selfie cam grabbing a lot of details, provided there is good amount of light.-Software-This is basically running a close to stock version of Android Lollipop. It is running version 5.0.2 with a Stagefright patch already added to protect the phone from foreign attacks. There are a few changes to the software. For instance, the icons look like similar to the iPhone, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on whether you love or hate that style. Other than that, everything works just like stock Android. Except for one feature that Iâ€™m surprised isnâ€™t universal to all phones. That is the fact that this phone is reversible. It doesnâ€™t sound as exciting as fingerprint sensor, but it is a rather practical and underrated feature. Iâ€™ve answered the phone to test the sound quality and it wasnâ€™t until after I hung up that I realized the phone was upside down. It sounds equally good on either orientation and it is brilliant. Of course, if you donâ€™t like this (for some reason) there is always the option to turn it off. Overall, the light touch that Alcatel added onto Android hasnâ€™t hurt it much and any problems can be easily fixed.-Conclusion-I wasnâ€™t expecting to get a high quality phone, especially after my experience with an old model that I canâ€™t even remember the name. But Alcatel did deliver a high quality experience and an astonishing device. It does have some compromises, but Alcatel chose them wisely and the overall result is great. There is a couple of phones that compete in this range, but the biggest one is the Moto G. Is this better? Yes and no. For power users, I would still recommend the high end Moto G because of the extra RAM or even a OnePlus One, which is on sale now for $299. But if it must be under $200, like for college students like me, this beats the $179 low end Moto G due to the higher quality speakers, display, NFC, and the slightly more RAM. This phone helps to answer the question: Do people really need to spend over $800 on a phone to get a high quality experience? The answer for most people is no. They donâ€™t. There is a market for people who need to have the latest and greatest with all the new extras like fingerprint sensor and DSLR-like quality cameras. But for the rest of us, there are phone that does what we ask from it and reasonably well not just for the price, but just overall. If you are on the fence and frustrated from searching like I was, let me help you. Go for this phone and you wonâ€™t be disappointed. p
The rubber inner-sleeve does not look good on the phone. n
So far so good, awesome speakers on a little phone, can't beat the price p
As of late I've been on something of a "phone journey". I first purchased an Idol 3 5.5", but the phone was just too darn big to be practical (at least for me). I returned it, and then picked up the new Moto G 2015 (which I also did a review on). It was an excellent phone, but in the end I discovered it was missing some key features that I really needed in a daily driver device.First, the Moto G was missing a notification LED. Sure, some of you may think "who cares, it has Moto display", but there are times where this just isn't optimal. When the phone was on my desk and I happened to miss a notification (which normally flashed 3 times, but sometimes just once, probably bugged), to find out I even had one I had to either 1.) reach across the desk and wave my hand over the device, 2.) pick it up which would activate the screen (which didn't always work, either), or 3.) physically hit the power button. A notification LED eliminates the need for all of that fuss. That light is going to blink until I check/clear my notifications, for me this is PERFECT!Moto G is also missing a gyroscope. Not overly important to me (most of the time), but this is useful for things such as 360 degree YouTube videos, certain games, etc. Another win for Alcatel!Moto G doesn't include a magnetometer. Wanna use a compass app on the Moto G? Too bad, so sad. Alcatel 3 - Motorola 0.No NFC on the Moto G. Wanna pay using Android Pay in the future? Well, you can't do that with the Moto G! Idol 3 strikes again!Only 8GB internal storage on the similarly priced Moto G. What's that? You want 16GB for 179.99? Don't worry, Alcatel has you covered.Moto G only offers 1GB RAM on the 179.99 model. While 1GB is "sufficient" with careful usage, I'll gladly take 1.5GB for the same price, thanks Idol 3!The screen. While their resolutions are the same (1280 x 720), the Idol 3 4.7" sports a 312 PPI pixel density, while the Moto G only comes in at 294. More pixels? More clarity? Yup! I'll take it!Dual front facing speakers with JBL sound? They sound absolutely amazing. The Moto G at least had the decency to have its only speaker on the front, but there is zero contest here. These speakers sound just as good as the ones from the 5.5" Idol 3!While there are more positives, I just wanted to lay out the comparisons between the Idol 3 4.7" and the Moto G 2015 1GB model, as these are the most often compared devices. In my honest opinion, there is zero contest between the two and I feel that Alcatel did an amazing job on this device. At first I was a bit leery of the 1.2Ghz Quad Core CPU, but I've had zero issues with lollipop and everything is buttery smooth! I fully recommend this to anyone, as it is well worth the price of admission! p
Very good p
Extremely poor hardware which explains the low price. Its been 4 months and I already have a problem with the charging port. It's a struggle to get the phone to charge. n
Will definitely recommend for purchasing this product..got mine brand new and I'm extremely happy thanks again.. Delivery was fast too got it within 4 days of purchase p
It's good p
in all honesty were is it its not in the mailbox or outside very disappointed n
Odd feel. The basic reason for a phone is to talk right? This is the worst flaw in the phone. I had a hard time answering and placing phone calls. The phone seems to have a long pause at the oddest times. I am glad after one month this phone was ruined by water. I would hate to put up with this phone for 2 years. n
Best deal on an android phone, fast responsive, stereo front speakers sound great and battery life is very good, overall look and feel of this phone excellent. Screen is sharp with good color tones. p
Nice p
For the first two weeks before the update it reboots just idling but now ok. Just make sure you get your settings keyed in correctly. p
It's a great smartphone at a super affordable price! I was looking for a reliable budget smartphone to purchase for my parents, who were learning to use smartphones for the first time. So something basic with a long battery life was ideal. After looking intensively at budget smartphones, I narrowed my choices down to the Alcatel OneTouch or the Moto G (3rd Gen). I was ultimately swayed by the Alcatel because they had the 4.7" screen size option and I am glad it worked out well.It was very easy to learn and use, great camera, decent battery life, and my mom loves it. The only comment I have to add, is the limited options for changing the language. There were a couple of options, but Chinese was not one of them. If language settings are a top concern for purchasing this phone, I would suggest you to find out what options you would need. (I know the Moto G offers a couple more languages, including Chinese.) Otherwise, I have no other complaints. I would even consider getting this phone for myself! p
I love this phone. I don't know what other smart phones do that cost 5x more than the Idol 3. I like it to fit in my shirt pocket. It is thin and not too heavy in this era monster phone screen sizes. It looks great, but most people put their phone in some dopey protector case, so what is the big deal with the chrome and glimmery looks except on the commercials and in the show room. But this phone looks high class anyway. I hate to cover it up in a case. All operations are a "GO". One neg., and I was aware of this from Android phone reviewers - the camera. It takes great photos EXCEPT for back lit shots, then the photos turn out like you took the photo in a light fog. I got this phone, because I need a PHONE' so the camera I can give or take. For 99% of the camera shots it's totally fine. p
My prior phones were a galaxy s3 and LG G3 stylus. Both phones were great but this Alcatel one touch idol 4.7 is amazing. A little smaller than what I was hoping for, about the size of an iPhone 6, but it works smoothly and perfectly. Couldn't ask for a better phone. I currently use straight talk so all I had to do was literally insert my Sim and configure the Internet apn settings and within 5 minutes, the phone works, data works, texting and mms works amazing. Only complaint is when I'm on the phone with someone, I can't really hear then that well. But if your like me and all you do is text or surf the Web, this phone is perfect for you. Also, the front speaker(s) is amazing. Sound is very clear and honestly the best I have ever had. p
Love this phone! p
This would have been a great phone, except it keeps loosing network connectivity randomly (especially during phone calls) and I often have to speak very loudly in order to have the person on the other end of the call hear what I'm saying.All in all, a big disappointment. n
Best versatile phone out there. Has a lot of upgraded features from it's past generations but the idol 3 has came along way in a view of a flagship inexpensive phone. I love the phone and how it is gsm unlocked. Well done Alcatel. I'm curious if Alcatel is going to come out with a new generation of one touch. p
This device was really enjoyed to use and everything about it was pretty good if I had any gripe it would have to be the bubbly icon but that's just nitpicking. For more information on this device please search for Eric Drummond on YouTube p
Great phone for the money. Only had it 2 days but loving it so far. p
Trust me this is a good phone.I habmve used and owned nexus 5, one plus one, galaxy s5, htc m8.....ipad air 2 chromebook laptop........I love it stuff and this is a good phoneI have read all the reviews here but ill write the best one.Pros.Size. Weight. Portablity. Right screen. Great speakers. Price. Good battery life. Pretty quick charging time.Cons. A little slow (but get used it)Touch pad is not great when typing stuff. I think that alcatel used the cheap screen panel.No haptic feedback when using touch screen for writing and texting.Some bugs that can be fixed but the alcatel seems like they dont support the device much.No android 6.0Cant pair with Bluetooth all the time. Idk why..I think that this phone is way better than galaxy alpha and a3.For moto g...... if you like a big heavy phone then get it..... moto g is a slighly faster but i think alCatel is better.......Ask me anything about this phone. p
This phone was bought by my father for my step-mother. My dad does lots of research before buying new phones...because he wants a cheaper phone, with decent reviews. This past weekend, my step mother had to reach out to me to ask how to display her contacts as they were not automatically joined with the transfer from her old phone. It was an easy fix, but a frustrating solution none the less. There is no Swype functionality either, so I had to download the google swype keyboard to provide that functionality for her. Other than a few other minor usability things, the phone has a nice feel to it, the apps are familiar looking and as long as you have some smart phone knowledge, the phone is fairly easy to navigate. n
The phone is awesome for the price so worth it. It's perfect hand size but the 5.5" screen would be nicer, but for the extra $70- 80 or w.e. the difference is. It was out of my personal budget p
Hereâ€™s why I went with the Acatel Idol 3 at 4.7 inches over the 3rd Gen Moto G. Both at $179.Size: Idol is 4.7 inches vs. Moto is 5.0 inches. Iâ€™m done with big phones. I wish everyone else would be too so we can start seeing more 4.5 - 4.7 inch phones with the latest specs, but thatâ€™s not going to happen anytime soonâ€¦Internal capacity: Idol has 16 GB vs. Motoâ€™s 8 GB for same price. Both have micro SD so maybe internal capacity doesnâ€™t matter to people.RAM: 1.5 GB vs. 1.0 GBDisplay: 312 ppi vs. 294 ppiNFC: yes vs. no. Looking forward to trying out the NFC tags. For $10 bucks itâ€™s worth a look.Sound: Stereo speakers vs. single; JBL speakers vs. who knows, JBL headphones included vs. noneMicrophone: dual vs. single; You can use the Idol in either orientation.Customization: no vs. yesWeight: 110 grams vs. 155 gramsBattery: 2000 mAh vs. 2470Water resistance: no vs. yesSimilar Snapdragon 4101.2 GHz vs. 1.4 GHzSimilar Camera - 13 MP back, 5 MP frontBottom line for the Idol 3:16 GB, 1.5 GB RAM, slightly better screen, lighter, little smaller, little thinner, dual speakers and microphones.It's thin, light, and fast with a nice crisp screen.I donâ€™t care about customization or water resistance. p
So far so good. Needed a stopgap for my old Nexus 5 since the battery has died by noon everyday in recent weeks. I've tried a few of the 5.5" mid-range phones that have been released recently and none of them seem to be right for me. I just can't seem to get used to using a larger phone. Started using this phone 2 days ago and it's been great so far.No stuttering at all, and has kept the same pace as my Nexus did, yet the battery has lasted albeit with weekend usage. The standby on this phone is Apple-esqe, I left it off the charger overnight and lost 2% of battery life. I'll get a chance to see what normal business use will get me today.The speakers on this phone are some of the best I've ever heard on a smart phone. Loud and clear. I don't normally use my phone speaker as I will connect to a bluetooth speaker in the house, but it's not really needed any longer.Phone feels very solid in the hand for a phone that is entirely plastic, but it is VERY light.For $175 this phone is a bargain so far.*Edit* Not sure if its just a bad handset or an issue with this phone but when connected to a call via Bluetooth I hear a loud clicking noise. Sounds a bit like a helicopter over the call. Tried it in my car and with 2 sets of Bluetooth headphones, all three have the same sound. It's a shame was loving this phone. n
UPDATE November 2016 -I have downgraded my rating of this phone due to a system update patch dated November 1, 2016. This update kills the functionality of the 'tap to wake' feature that lets you tap on the screen to wake it up. This is a WONDERFUL feature that I loved on this phone. But this feature was largely killed with the November 2016 update. It now only works MAYBE 5% of the time I tap the screen to wake it. This is a REALLY obnoxious killing of a great feature. If Alcatel eliminates great features like this after purchase it eliminates my trust in the company and I would not buy an Alcatel product in the future because of this. I don't particularly care if this was intentional or is just a bug. They sent an update patch that changed something I don't want changed. That's a screw up and I'm not happy.â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘GOOD PHONE / OKAY CAMERAâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘I got this for my wife to replace the Galaxy S6 we bought a few months ago. Turns out that phone was just too darn big. The Idol 3 4.7" version ends up being perfectly sized for a normal personâ€™s hand.This is a nice phone in general. It's a great phone when you factor in the price and overall value. With the hardware being so capable for such a reasonable price this phone could be a game changer for the Smartphone industry, forcing the major players to bring pricing down. I said the same thing about the 5.5" version of the Idol 3 a few months ago and with the popularity that device and the ASUS ZenFone 2 are enjoying in this price range, I am convinced you'll see more reasonably priced phones from the major market players in the next 2 years.â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘THE GOODâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â– The sound - The front facing JBL speakers make this a solid rival to the HTC One M9. If you use your phone for multi media like watching videos or listening to music without headphones this is a solid sound system for you. The sound is vibrant and most importantly it's loud. And it's clear sound. It doesn't sound like a tiny cell phone speaker. It sounds like a real speaker. The HTC One product line made the front facing speakers it's calling card and no one really challenged the HTC design until now. The Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 stands toe to toe with the HTC One sound and doesn't flinch.â– It physically looks like a nice phone, not a cheap off brand.â– It's not the most powerful processor in a Smartphone, and it's a little lower powered than the 5.5" variant but it's plenty good enough to drive the Idol 3 for normal daily use. I didn't find it to be laggy at all doing normal stuff. Through all of the set up process and a couple hours of use there was no lag.â– It has expandable storage! Thank you for keeping this feature in a smart phone. I hate the cloud. I want to have my files on my device. The Idol 3 starts at 16GB on board (not all usable as the system takes up some of that) but it's expandable up to 128GB via the tried and true SD card method. So you can expand the storage significantly for $20-$50. Meanwhile some of the higher end Smartphones will charge you more than the entire purchase price of the Idol 3 to increase from a 32GB base model to a 128GB model.â– The HD 4.7" display is VERY nice. The colors are vibrant. They may be slightly more vibrant than true life colors, but it works. Photos look richer, even if you don't get true life coloring. All the rendered graphics look fantastic due to the rich color depth. (Meaning stuff like your icons and games and the UI interface, etc etc). The resolution is a little lower than the 5.5" version, but the screen is also smaller so it's not very noticeable. This phone sas the same resolution as the 30 inch HDTV in my bedroom.â– The back is flat! I like to lay my phone down on a desk or table next to me and be able to use it for things like checking a sports score or just checking off a notification or something. With a rounded back on the phone it will wobble and be annoying. The Idol 3 has a flat back so it lays flat on the table and doesn't wobble when you touch it. This is such a simple thing but it's HUGE for me.â– Itâ€™s SUPER thin. (See my picture with comparison next to my finger) Itâ€™s thinner than my Galaxy S4, with just a slightly smaller screen. (Itsâ€™ significantly smaller than screen on the Galaxy S6 we sold) And itâ€™s very light weight.â– The camera was an initial area of concern for me. Everything looked over exposed and blurry. This was largely fixed with an alternate camera app (more on that later). It's still not the greatest camera in the world, but I have to factor in the price tag on the phone. For $180 it's a good enough camera. In high light (outdoors in day time) it's actually pretty decent. In low light (anytime you need the flash) it's not so hot.â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘THE BADâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â– The stock camera app is complete garbage in all aspects. You can improve the photo quality a little by adjusting the manual settings, but you lose the settings as soon as you restart the app. It doesn't save them. On the stock settings everything is massively overexposed with the light balance making everything look blue. This almost caused me to return the phone, making me think the camera itself was bad. Plan on using an alternate camera app. I switched to Camera MX for photos. (Available on Amazon, but newer versions on Google Play) Camera MX has a conflict with video on this phone though and simply doesn't work. The stock camera app works okay for video.â– The battery is not replaceable. They do wear out after a while and I like to keep phones for years and repurpose them for other things after their service life as a phone expires. (As controllers for things, MP3 jukeboxes, etc) I like being able to go on Amazon, spend $20 on a replacement battery and quickly switch it out. Additionally, even if you don't keep your phones that long, batteries fail sometimes. So no replaceable battery is a problem for me. This might not be an issue for you. If not, great! But be aware of the issue before making purchase decisions. I sucked it up on this one because it's my wife's phone and she didn't care. But I don't love this industry trend.â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘THE BOTTOM LINEâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â– It EASILY outperforms it's $180 purchase price. It's not the greatest Smartphone of all time, but you cannot beat this phone for $180. I said the same thing about the 5.5" version's $250 price. The 4.7" isn't as good of a phone overall as the 5.5" which has more physical room in the housing to cram in better specs, but for $180 the 4.7" version is a great value, even with the camera not being an industry leader.â– Ultimately you have to decide what features are important to you. If you never use the camera or don't use it for anything you want to keep, like maybe you just take pictures of your parking space so you remember where you parked, it's a great smartphone. I love the form factor of it. It's thinness. It's weight. It's display. It's all very nice.â– Use an alternate camera app that gives you more control over the exposure. An alternate camera app changed my decision to return this phone. I had this as a 4 star review until I had better luck with different apps. I also compared the quality of the photos to the price tag of the phone and realized that it's a great value. You can get a better camera on a phone, but it will cost more to do it. For $180 you really can't go wrong. n
The phone came without issues. Have a great display and the processor responds well. Visually have a great look. For the price is a very good acquisition. p
This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet. n
Phone was purchased for my son. He's loving the phone so far and has been using it for a couple of months now. Takes pretty good pictures. Phone is snappy even only having 1.5gb of ram. Doesn't crash when he uses Snapchat which he's very happy about!!! His prior phone would crash on some apps. I'd highly recommend this phone for anybody on a budget & wanting a decent mid-range phone. Also, for anybody wondering this device did receive the Android M (Marshmallow) update. p
Very happy with this phone. My last one was also an Alcatel but only 4 gig, not near enough for all the popular software and photographs. 16 gig seems really good for my needs. Would buy again! p
The call quality is terrible, something between fade and tin can. Camera is ok, but image quality well below my previous phones, a Moto G and an LG. Most frustrating of all, after a month, the first time I dropped the phone the screen shattered and that was with an outer casing accessory. The only redeeming quality was the compact size. n
On point and fair at $149. I love this little phone! p
Great phone p
Great phone and much more dependable than other phones in its price range. Great pics and easy to use. The only con is battery life. If you use location services and bluetooth then you must charge everyday. Other than that I love the phone. p
The phone came in its original box with a security seal, not only did it come with a good charger(the one that you can plug into a computer or wall) but it also came with JBL headphones.Also, product came in 2 days.I cant believe I got all this with such good quality for such a good price.Definitely a good buy. p
Pretty solid battery life. Fast. BIG sound. Just wish the camera had a little more zoom and the screen is only about 4in max. But the camera is quite clear and good hd screen p
Great phone ....great price. Works seamlessly on T-Mobile. p
I really like the size and weight of this phone. A friend has a Samsung Galaxy S6 and we both think it's too bulky. Personal preference...It's nice to have a micro SD to load up with photos and music. Music player is fun to mess with. If I could change one thing it would be dual SIM.Works great with US-Mobile. No complaints. p
strongly recommend it. p
very good p
Sometime get hot and battery running out quick n
This phone is for music lovers right? Speakers are good but my Bluetooth is horrible I put the phone in my pocket and simply turn around and my Bluetooth speaker will cut out don't have that problem with other phones anyone else have this problem? Did drop the phone once before I activated it though. Hitting the power and volume down at the same time will do a screenshot which seems almost unavoidable and it happens all the time and is really getting on my nerves hell my home screen freaked out or so I thought until I realized I was looking at a s***load of screenshots can't find an option the disable this feature yet. The cameras focus is horrible compared to my old Moto E and my Samsung Avant. Something about unlocking the screen and about the way the notifications work has really been annoying. I going to fix my old samsung Avant a throw this one in the trash if I can't find an easy fix for most of these issues n
Got it as a gift for my dad in India, replaced his Micromax phone. Dad is super delighted. Superb performance, very good photography, long battery life, super slim. Android is not overly skinned but practical and lightweight.BTW, the next generation of this phone (Idol 4) is the Blackberry Android phone. Strong cred there! p
The Alcatel Idol 3 compact (4.7) is a decent phone.The good:Nice form. Slim, and easily held in one hand.Good performance (connectivity, tasks, etc....)Great stereo sound with the built in speakers. As a music listening device it's terrific.The bad:Unfortunately as a phone it's really not great.Could only faintly hear the other person in my apartment (even with the volume maxed), and on a noisy NYC street it was nearly impossible.The battery life is terrible. I suspect I might've gotten a dud, because with very light use (listening to music and checking emails a couple of times), the phone barely lasted a little more than half a day.Overall, the low volume and bad battery life made me return it quickly. Too bad, as everything else is very nice. n
Thin, sharp, stereo, best for the price! Smart move. p
It works great for my niece p
Perfect cell phone p
Very good p
Iv'e had the phone for around a week now and just love it. From the form factor to the amazing front firing speakers to the intuitive stock android lollipop interface. I am using it on cricket wireless and everything just worked right away once i popped my sim card in. Wifi and LTE reception are on par or possibly superior to the LG G2 i replaced. Battery life on standby isnt quite as good as my G2, but while actually using the phone (watching videos especially) it mops the floor of the G2 in terms on on screen time. This is due to the lower res (but still very nice) screen and lower power snapdragon 410 CPU. Dont let the lower power fool you, ive yet to run into any scenario the phone hasnt performed just as well as my G2, which on paper is twice as fast. Just a heads up to buyers of the 5.5" model (too big for my tastes, but seems to be the preferred size nowadays) is that it is coming to cricket wireless nov 6th for 149.00 bucks, 100 bucks off retail. Mind you it wont be unlocked, this would just be for people using cricket, and as a cricket customer i have only good things to say about them (they use ATT towers, they are the best MNVO by miles).The only con i can come up with on the phone is that it does not beep at you when fully charged, but the LED light goes off after its been at 100% for a couple minutes. I remedied this with an app called Gsam for the app store, now my phone beeps when it hits 100% :)In my opinion this blows away the competition (looking at you moto g) for the money, 16gb storage and 1.5gb memory really put it head and shoulders above other phones in this price range. Not to mention the better screen, absurdly loud speakers and overall dainty form factor (for a phone in 2015).Trust me, you will not regret this purchase, especially if you are looking for a phone under the "norm" 5"+ form factor. p
Great product! I'm loving the smaller phone. It's a breath of fresh air from all these phablets and near phablets. I guess I'm in a minority for wanting a smaller phone. Battery life is great and performance is really good. I can't see any lags navigating through menus. I don't play games on my phone so I'm not sure how good the graphics processor. It has outstanding standby time. The screen is great even under sun light. The phone is very light and it produces incredible sound from its dual stereo front facing speakers. The screen is very crisp despite not being 1080P (not a knock, anything below 5" screen doesn't need a 1080P screen). I've had the 5.5" version but found it a bit too big for my taste. This phone is perfect, it's even a tad bit smaller than an iPhone 6/6S. 16GB is fine paired up with my 64GB Sandisk memory card. I didn't even think about the Moto G 2015 because with 16GB it's already close to the Idol 3 5.5" ~$250 price. I'm not so worried about updates. As long as there are security patches and the apps work, then it's fine. p
Excellent! Many thanks. p
Great product p
Nice it was allÃ¡ that im expected p
I was originally looking for a Samsung phone, but I wanted the latest version of Android in a phone that would fit in my pocket. The Idol 3 was just what I needed. Pictures are great for a phone, the OS runs smoothly, battery life is good - gets me through the day easily on a full charge, and it's a great size. The only irritating thing is answering the "what kind of phone is that?" question then watching the confused looks because they've never heard of Alcatel. I'm certainly glad to have skipped the "big names". p
The phone looks nice and works smoothly. Definitely worth the price. The cameras, both front and back, take crisp clear pictures. Very happy with the product. p
Excelent phone for the price p
So far so good! I have had it for a few months now have not had one problem. Speakers are really great p
Update 3/07/16:I have moved my rating from a 4 to 5.The TracFone AT&T 4G LTE sim works great at Bodega Bay. So we have good connections in what has been a blackout area for years.I upgraded my text system to the MySms premium for better texting and easier texting pictures to family and friends.I added Camera MX for better picture taking and ease of transmitting pictures with the MySms as noted above. The system works seamlessly with Amazon Prime Photos. Take a picture. In a short time it is on Amazon Prime, and I can text the photos to our friends and family in seconds. I have just scratched the surface with the capabilities of Camera MX, and it surpasses any phone camera or camera I have had in over a decade.The battery continues to be amazing and also eliminates the drain on my Android tablet / Chromebook with the MySyms connection.So this great phone fits in my pockets is powerful and does anything I need or want with the phone, internet connection and camera +4G LTE!The cost of this is about $200.The first part of the below is for Tracfone customers/users. If you donâ€™t use Tracfone, go below the dotted line for my review.For a week, my new Alcatel Idol 3, 4.7 didnâ€™t work with my transferred Tracfone minutes and years of use. The Tracfone site showed that my BYOP transfer had worked with my new BYOP sim card, and all of my minutes, data and time left were transferred. The phone didnâ€™t work to make/receive calls or texts.Alcatel was of no help. A friend suggested that I email Tracfone to set up a phone call with them. I did and got online, with someone as per the email from them. He claimed they didnâ€™t have any of my data. Including tracfone phone # and id #â€™s. Fortunately, I had made a hard copy of what I had re time and years on my old smartphone and what Tracfone showed with my new Sim cardI told him that I needed to speak with someone, who could help me. Then on hold for 15 minutes, when a nice woman answered and again wanted all the data I had emailed and told the other phone person. After, I re told her the specific data, reading from my hard copy made the day the BYOP was supposedly activated. Then, she said I didnâ€™t have anytime left on my contract, and I need to buy more time. I reminded her of the hard data showing over 2000 minutes and time of agreement for years to come. That was a 30 minute + call process.She said that she had to transfer me to another supervisor. She did, and the new person started asking for my data given twice that call. I said that I had sent all of that in via email, and I had given that data twice on the same phone call. She found my contract and said my phone wasnâ€™t 4.7 working because my time/minutes/data hadnâ€™t been transferred. She did her thing on her end and my phone fired up and I dialed in the code to activate it.It now works with well over one hour on the phone going over same stuff 3 times with Tracfone on line people------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Evaluation of this phone is now 5 stars.Before, I got my Tracfone problem corrected, I had used my new phone via wifi to transfer the contacts, pictures and apps from my old android LG phone. Most of this went well. The transfer of stuff from a nearby or close Android (Acer tablet, old Android phone and my Acer Chromebook 15, which Iâ€™m using for this report), didnâ€™t work.The wifi reception is good but not as strong as my wifeâ€™s Alcatel One Touch Android. Where I use it at home, the wifi reception is strong and very fast.The 4.7â€ screen fits in my shirt pockets even after the bottom half of the add on hard case was added.The screen size is adequate for what I want to do away from home, to make/receive phone calls and text/receive and check texts and emails. I will use my Acer 8 tablet or my Chromebook for more involved keyboard/screen work at home.The battery, so far is adequate so far for my uses. Last night it was @ Â¾ charge, and I didnâ€™t charge it. This morning it was still @ Â¾ charged and again at 2 pm this afternoon. When, I picked it up again and turned it on it was still at 3/4.Bloatware is at a minimum.It accepted my 64 gig card with no fuss.The Android 5.0 seems to be smoother and less drag than our previous 4.?.It works smoothly with MY SMS which I have on my tablet and Chromebook.Also, when you receive a phone call, you donâ€™t push or make contact directly with the phone Icon. You have slide that Icon to the right to answer. I have had cell phones since the 1990â€™s, and that is different.Since the phone is now working with Tracfone, I have to push the app buttons on the screen harder than before.The glass add on screen I bought is too big. The standard screen gets very messy very quickly with minimal useage. I will try to find an aftermarket glass that fits.The combo hard case and belt case (extra buy) is a mixed picture. The hard case fits fairly well;however if you attach that to the other half of the hard case, you canâ€™t really get the camera out to make phone calls, receive them or to take a picture. You have to remove the part that covers the phone and the back part of the case. I missed two phone calls from my wife due to this time delay to get to the front of the phone. Also, I didnâ€™t get a picture of some on the move wildlife in our area due to this problemIf you use Tracfone BYOP, and your phone doesnâ€™t work. Donâ€™t waste your time contacting Alcatel. Send Tracfone an email with your data and tell them your phone isnâ€™t working. Tracfone will send you an email with a phone# and a numeric code to use. When you, make that call, sit in a comfortable chair and have a hardline phone available, all of your data available, a bottle of water, a lot of patience, and your well charged Alcatel Idol 3. I used my Acer Chromebook to help with the data, the â€œlostâ€ data and other stuff they needed.In this short time, I think that Alcatel and Tracfone have a good winning combo. If you use Tracfoneâ€™s BYOP, and you are an established customer wanting to transfer your minutes and time, be sure to make hard copies of your minutes and data. You will probably need that data.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update re the battery. It is an excellent battery with heavy use. It is the best cell phone battery, we have ever owned re standby. It holds the charge in standby versus our other androids phones and tablets using the battery charge overnight or just standing unplugged.Re wifi connections. It quickly recognizes our home wifi and connects and other hot spots seamlessly. Its wifi range in our house isn't as good as my wife's Alcatel One Touch Popup, which is incredible re its wifi range. However, since I never use these phones in our bedroom and a few other weak wifi areas, that is not an issue. The auto switch from wifi to Tracfone 4G LTE like going from our family room to our back yard is auto and seamless. So far the Tracfone/AT&T 4G LTE in our area is very strong and reliable. Hopeoufully, we can try the AT&T 4G LTE in/on our coastal areas where our Verizon/Trackfone coverage is zero.The Android 5.? seems to be more reliable and easier to do simple things with versus the Android 4.?'s. p
Great specs on an inexpensive phone. Works well. Not waterproof as my wife found out with her first one....but good enough to buy again. p
The Internet is so slow on this phone. Can only work good while connected to the wifi. n
This is a good phone. I would have liked a instruction book with it. I did download one off the internet. But I need to study it. There are still features which I have to figure out. On the whole I really like this phone. One feature I either have not figured out, it's not working right, or it is the way it is made. Is the sound of it dialing, when I call someone is not very loud. And I have not found a way to make the dial tone louder. I have some trouble with hearing, but my husband, being definitely hard of hearing may not be able to hear it, or want to use it. p
I brought this phone for my son for Christmas and he loves it. We are with T-Mobile. He switched his SIM card from his old phone to this phone and hasn't had any problems at all. p
Very good model, love Alcatel One Touch !!! very good supplier also!! I received it quickly!! GREAT !! p
Excellent phone. Great headphones! p
I would not recommend this phone for people who need simple functionality or good Bluetooth capabilities. I came from having a moto g, and I think you really do get what you pay for. After 3 months with this phone, I am counting it as a loss and going back to Motorola. It takes 3x longer to do anything you need to do on this phone. The keyboard is not responsive and poorly calibrated, the speakers aren't great, and there are no compatible apps that compare to Motorola assist. Making phone calls takes about three extra steps, and I rarely am able to make or receive calls due to poor reception. I would blame that on the phone service company, but my boyfriend and I are on a family plan and he gets reception when I don't. The text message app is horrible, I downloaded a new one to make it usuable. This phone would be a good starter phone for a teenager, but that's about it. The speakers are bad enough that I have to use speaker phone to make calls (I'm 25) n
Good phone for the price, a nice screen with a nice sound, and a fluid interface. p
Good solid phone at a very low price for all it offers. Stable and fast, definetly worth the shot. p
I bought 2 UNITS OF THIS CELL PHONE, HO HAVE DEPRECIATION OF $ 20 EACH, I feel ripped off, RETURN MY MONEY, NOT SEE POSSIBLE IN PROMOTION THIS SAME IN $ 169 NOW $ 149 PAGE MORE FOR THE SAME PHONE LESS ONE WEEK, RETURNING THIS DIFFERENCE IN A BONO GIFTCARD n
Have only owned it for about a week. Battery saver is excellent for me but if you're walking around with the phone in your pocket, it will detect motion and may not sleep as you might expect. Mine sits on a table much of the day and so it sleeps soundly. :-) Speakers are nice JBL but bass response is still lacking which is inherent in the extremely thin design of this phone. You may need to install an equalizer to reduce mid and high frequencies for a richer sound. I would have given 5 stars except that there is a small "sweet spot" when listening on a phone call. If the phone is not placed just so on the ear, the volume is reduced significantly. I think it just takes some practice. The dual speakers and dual microphones work beautifully for quickly answering phone upside down if necessary. FM radio will not run unless earphones are plugged in as they act as an antenna. Display is perfect for me. Some built in wallpapers look pixelated but they're probably just crappy samples. As you'll see with Android 5, you cannot have a different wallpaper on your lock screen. So much for using it as a quick flashlight like I did with my old phone.Android 5 does come with a flashlight hidden in the SECOND pull-down notification menu with the Bluetooth and WiFi buttons. The flashlight is not an "app". Note: WiFi does NOT turn on using the "WiFi Display" app. You must use either the settings menu or the second pull down menu to do that. This phone has an auto-dimming screen which also automatically brightens to max when in sunlight. VERY nice feature but you may find that a nearby light source in a dark room could fool the sensor and make it dimmer than you want it. Just adjust the angle of the screen so that the sensor detects the light and the screen will brighten accordingly. You can also turn this feature off.This is not a "department store" brand. They are sold at T-Mobile stores and I was told by a clerk that the Idol 3 is really nice and they don't have it to sell because they were sent a lesser version by corporate.Almost forgot to mention the most important thing; This phone is an upgrade from my 3 year old Samsung which was loading pages agonizingly slow. This Alcatel with Android 5 and LTE loads pages almost instantly! AND this phone is eligible for the Android 6 Marshmallow upgrade as soon as it is available. No luck yet trying to upgrade but I love it! Marshmallow will allow you to override permissions for each app. Other than that, not much change.If you sign up for an Amazon Signature card like I did, you can get an extra $50. off this phone. BEWARE: Amazon automatically changes your default payment method to the new card! If you don't want that, go to your settings and change it back to your old card. Also, the phone must be purchased with the Amazon card to get the discount. So remember to pay off the card right away if you don't want interest charged. You have 21 days grace period. I've had this card before. Keep an eye on your default payment before you check out because it was changed on me once before without my knowledge before making a purchase. One-click ordering is what caused it to happen to me as it does not give you an opportunity to see your default payment method. p
at first 4 days, phone feels solid but will not recognized new external 16GB extermal micro SD card. i tried reboot, formating card, and re-installing SD Card but nothing. when i go to settings, storage..it says mount SD card, when i click ....nothing. frustrating as this is why i dumped my old LG optimus F6. n
i just bought 2, 4.7 inch versions one for me and one for my wife, for some reason with both phones when i take a video there is no sound on playback. i even tried uploading it to my google photos app but still no sound on any video taken!!! PLEASE how can i fix this? already tried rebooting, factory reset, erasing cache and raising all volumes on sounds and messaging. n
Bought this phone to replace my wife's phone which is several years old and needed replacing. The phone came boxed with the charger, cord, headphones and instructions. There were English instructions that were well written and easy to follow. It took us about 30 minutes to set up the phone for here and move everything thing over. It has working flawlessly since we got it and she is very pleased with it. It is not going to compete with some of very high end phones but it does have a quad core processor and plenty of speed for what she does. For the price, this is one of the nicest phones that I have seen p
excellent goods for me p
good p
Hello bought this phone in Sept 2015 now April 2nd the phone is dead, battery probably . So pretty upset I've had phone for 5 1/2 months. Its covered under the 1 year warranty. I will be calling Alcatel Modnay not happy about being without a phone for 3 weeks as i hear on the net. I lliked this phone on every category, voice calls, text, camera good, fast etc but ignored that you can't replace the battery. I'll let you know what happens with manufacturer. Called Alcatel customer service on battery all good 1-855-368-0829 p
Awesome no frills unlocked phone. Works great on T-Mobile and gets all the bands so coverage is excellent compared to my old unlocked ATT phone. p
This is a very nice phone and I am almost 100% pleased with it, especially the battery life. It outshines my old iPhone 4s battery life by miles.First the cons: I do not like that the wake up/power button is directly opposite of the volume bar switch. The iPhone wake button is much better placed. I also do not like that you have to bring up settings and then ringtones and then scroll to None click on it and then click OK to turn off the ringer and use only vibrate, here again the iPhone has it beat hands down with the little switch on the side.Now the Pros: The screen is really nice and much easier to keep clean that the iPhone, the operating system has IPhone beat hands down, the speaker system is really much more that I expected from a device this small and, to top it off you can answer it from either end with the reversible microphone. The battery life is really great compared to my old iPhone4s. Over all this phone rates about a solid 95%.I am using it on Wal-Mart's family plan which is serviced by T-Mobile and the signal is not quite as good as Verizon was with my old iPhone but it the service is acceptable for what I use it for. I do feel tho it would be stronger on AT&T snd I may at some point switch to them but for now it is serving my purposes well. p
I've had ZTE AWE, LG G2, iPhone 5s, Idol 3 5.5" and now Idol 3 4.7".This phone is slim, light, and perfect size for the pocket and web browsing. The Idol 5.5" was too large to keep comfortably in my pocket without breaking it.The screen has a yellower white, which I like better for reading. The screen of the Idol 5.5" had a bright bluish white, which often hurt my eyes.

I always thought that I needed 3000 mAh for a whole day operation but the new version of Android is surprisingly battery efficient.The sound from the phone speakers is loud and clear with some depth, but definitely not with super bass or "like from big speakers", as some reviews are claiming. Strangely, the ringing and notifications are decreased in volume when headphones are plugged in - definitely a software bug that Alcatel has to straighten out.While the sound through the on-board speakers is good, JBL did an exceptionally poor job with the sound enhancement through headphones, for which I am removing one star. Most cheap earbuds (less than $20) that I tried with the Idol 3 sounded with weak bass. Turning on the JBL "audio effects" attempts to create surround sound by distancing/depressing the mid frequencies, corresponding to human voices. That results in decreased clarity and "muddy" sound. The included JBL earphones were the worst from the b
