I hate smartphones. Only the need for an unlocked device persuaded me to sup with the devil. I long for a simple flip-phone. OK this phartsmone seems to be very acceptable. Once I figured out how to answer a phone call I was very happy. What I cannot shake is the feeling that all these icon things are sucking my PAYG airtime into a black hole. So I keep it turned off - that defeats the gremlins! Should you buy this phone? I'd say it does the job that you would expect of a more expensive unit and it's worth the money. I transitioned from the USA to South Africa and it's fine. I'm not fond of micro-sims for SA because the USB modems for my laptop take full size sims and I don't want to access the internet from a phone, dammit. I hate it. But you'll like it because you are not old and crotchety like me. p
Fast shipping,good phone p
Mobile is excellent and I bought it for my wife and she liked it a lot.. p
Just received my new Alcatel one touch idol 3 and was happy with it for about an hour until I tried taking a video and during playback the audio was muffled and cut in and out because microphones don't pick up noises that are on the quite side. I think it has a background noise cancelling feature built into the microphone but they cut out to much noise and there's no option to adjust sensitivity, or they just put crappy microphones in the phone to cut cost. Other than that everything else was good about the phone but the bad microphones were a deal breaker for me, I sent mine back. n
Great speaker loud and clear,best sound ever. Camera is great pictures are clear day or night. Easy to use! p
Excellent p
This phone sounds great! It's the only phone I can stand to use the speakerphone. I bought this phone for my wife, and she loves it. p
Slow and dead at 14 months. I liked the bright screen and the sound but it no longer works. n
Good sized phone with no connection issues. The price is not too high for anyone looking for something with an HD screen. p
I have had this phone for almost a week. Not one problem. Other than a few lags here and there. A great phone for a unheard of price. I paid $150 for this phone and it runs and feels like a $800 flagship phone. Only down side is I wish it had 4 Gigabyte's of RAM and not the 2 Gigabyte's. p
Phone suffered a screen crack riding in my pocket for 5 minutes while driving 2 months after being purchased. Not very durable. I would not buy it again. n
Very good phone p
Great phone, great service, and fast. Really great music and headphones. p
I love this phone for the price! This is my 4th Android phone over many years and by far the best yet. The screen is great, the sound is way better than any phone I've heard and the camera... it's no DSLR but hey, what do you expect for a phone? If you're expecting an iPhone 6s+ here, you may be disappointed. But for what most people use a phone for: Phone calls, check email or Facebook, look up something on the web, take a picture, it's just fine.I don't play games on this so I can't speak for the performance in that department. My guess is that you would want something a little more zippy if you're using graphics intensive apps.I have not experienced any issues with listening to audio (Pandora, PowerAmp, Google Music, Dogcatcher) or the bluetooth connection as some of the reviews may lead you to believe. I listen to music and podcasts using bluetooth to my car and a few pairs of bluetooth headsets with no stuttering or frequent dropouts. Audio quality is great over BT.The phone is updated regularly by Alcatel.Hate to say it, but sometimes things don't work out of the box. Sorry to hear that the customer service isn't great but again, you're more than welcome to spend $800 for an iPhone or Samsung if you want the best experience possible. I'll take my chances and save a bunch of cash, thank you! Going on 4 months with no issues on this one. Oh, if you're going to drop any phone, get a case! Just saying. p
Its been more then 6 months i am using this mobile . i liked it. Perfect size , for watching video on go and reading books. Awesome sound quality by the way i love JBL sound mixer app Camera quality is really good Battery Life is good and charge pretty fast with its own charger. All in all i like this mobile p
Great phone. But where can I find a screen? n
Only wished it was dual sim. p
Excelent smartphone. Affordable. Fast. 100% recommended. p
Excellent mid price phone. Has met all of my expectations. The screen and two front speakers are beyond great. p
The Idol 3 smartphone is so thin and light that, despite its large 4.7" diagonal screen, it doesn't feel any bulkier in my bluejeans pocket than my 5-year-old prior smartphone did, Great job. p
i have owned this device for two months and the left top corner of the device is cracked already just from carryng in my pocket and 1/2 bottom of the screen is not working anymore i dont know what to do... if you go to another forums like XDA you'll see that im not the only one having issues with this device a ton of people had the same exact problem, i feel sad because is a great phone but unfortunately is made from really cheap materials i would recomend to save a little more money and get another device rather than this... n
Amazing phone! For $250 it compares if not out does my friends galaxy s6. p
I bought this phone for my daughter last June 14th and 90 days later, September 16th the phone is dead, no scratches or ding on the phone, nothing. It looks new because from day one it had hard case and film protector. Amazon warranty is over so my daughter called Alcatel almost 10 times to obtain the RMA, to send the phone to get checked and repaired. I like to know why a new phone dies after only 90 days? Nice apologize by Alcatel, but they have yet to send the promised email containing the return label, only providing excuses stating that they "understand our frustration". We need solution not excuses. It should be replaced by Alcatel, as it is truly a defective product, not just repaired.Summary: Phone died after only 90 days, Alcatel customer service has been sub-par, promising to provide a shipping label to get the phone repaired but never actually sending it. Don't waste your money with this phone. n
Excellent phone p
I'm all for using my money wisely did a lot of research and this phone does everything I need and more! I am a heavy phone user, this phone this its job. AT&T is my phone carrier I had the option for an upgrade through them but they have this new program where you rent phones for a monthly fee and if you bought a phone outright FROM THEM it would bring in another fee. Basically they want you to rent the phones now. I went to play C and bought this phone so i could save money in the long run. p
Regular case for impact p
You simply can beat the price!.I really love the way this smartphone looks. Both the screen and the audio are the best part!. p
I had a great hope for this product.This phone is far better than other phones in the same range, But after using this for a month I am bit disappointed. Here is my experience with this mobile.Good:> Nice screen. The screen is clearly visible in sunlight. Dont be fooled by other phones with great specs. This screen works.> Good battery life. With casual usage ( net, calling, youtube, small games, text ) this phone lasted for more than a day for me.> Awesome sound quality. With dual JBL speakers and headphones. The sound is just awesome. Call quality is also clear.OK:> Ergonomics is OK. With this screen size, holding the phone is bit difficult to hold and they have not provided any special software ( like asus zenphone ) to make it easy.> software. Pure android for most of the part.Bad:> Performance.Dont be fooled by 2GB ram and quad core CPU. This phone is laggy. its the deal breaker.> Camera: The autofocus of the camera is useless. By the time you click , the lens looses its focus and the image is blurry. Same with video.Terrible.>Software: Not much customization offered. Too little.Conclusion: With oneplus one and many other mobiles offering better specs and better performance this mobile is not a good choice to go at this point in time. n
Im absolutely amazed with the sound of the speakers, I have an HTC m8 and JBL speakers from the idol sounds for me louder and better. It's a great phone for its price, the only thing that kind of dissaponted me was the camera resolution at low light or dark spaces it is just not good compared to my HTC camera. But overall happy with the purchase , I bought a second idol 3 phone after the first one cause it really worth it. Also double tap doesn't react so quick, as my HTC m8 but it's no big deal. Other thing I loved about the idol is the reverse screen. And the headphones JBL, just great add for this great phone.I'm an HTC user telling that this phone is nearly a high end class phone , it looks, feels,sounds just amazing. And battery life no worries you can end your day of usage and go home at night to charge it.Fully recommended. p
Horribleeee experience with this cell phone... i bought the first one through amazon and it came used (i ordered a new one). then i tried ordering it through alcatel webpage and it came defective!! the color in the screens were all wrong. horrible brand. n
So far very good! p
Great phone and great price p
Nice smartphone for reasonable price. Not the best performance but the dual JBL speakers are really loud and phone has a nice design.I have been using it for 2 months and one of my family member likes it so much, I ended up buying a second one for them. p
The phone is great,the earplugs good stereo sound but the male insert for the phone charger too small-falls out . p
I was sceptical at first despite the reviews and after owning one i am anxious for the model. I love this phone. p
I love this phone more and more. It has 16gb memory that is bogged down with tons of preloaded apps so I haven't even needed to use the SD memory yet. It is a slim, nice looking phone. It's camera works pretty well with my only complaint being how dark videos are in dim light. Its dual front facing speakers are loud and clear and I love that they face you when watching videos. I have cricket and have had no dropped calls with it so far. And above all it was such a reasonable price for everything considered. p
The camera on this was terrible. For a 13 MP camera, the colors in the pics were washed out and many of them were shaky, I suppose that's where the lack of image stabilization comes into play, especially with indoor photos. And the 8MP front facing camera when used indoors had so much noise I was simply shocked at the result. Black or shadowy areas were full of noise and even lighted spaces were fuzzy. My Samsung's 2.1 MP front camera outperformed the Idol 3 which was very surprising.In outside lighting the camera was merely decent, but some backgrounds would be washed out. Playing with the exposure helped some, but simply not enough. I also read that perhaps you could download a different camera app that would help with the faded issue, but that really shouldn't be necessary for a 13 MP camera. Also many tech reviews about the camera were positive, so either I had a faulty device or my standards are just way too high.I was really disappointed since the phone itself was very nice and had some nice features that I didn't really get to explore. Anyhow, I sent it back. I ended up biting the bullet and laying down the cash for the LG G5. n
Strongly recommend it. The only downside if I will criticize it is , it doesn't support wi-fi calling. p
I couldn't even call on the phone, it said the phone was stolen. ðŸ˜‘ n
The phone is alright. It actually is very responsive and definitely worth the money. Only thing is, I'm a beefy user which means I download a lot of apps.This phone can handle it but that paired with my 4000 photos and 30 videos makes the experience a bit difficult to enjoy.Overall if you don't have my situation then you'll be fine. This phone can power through the everyday tasks with a breeze. Doesn't lag. Unless you have my situation.Battery life in my situation will last me about 3 hours. Without my situation it has lasted about 12 hours. With heavy usage were talking 8 hours. Not bad for a budget phone that won best phones of 2015 on CES for the best budget phones.The screen is awesome! Full HD and fully reversible. I have picked up my phone upsidedown taking it out my pocket or just picking it up off table or bed. Very useful feature.I have had the phone for about 3 months. Still is in good condition. The screen doesn't scratch easily. The phone looks of high quality.The speakers are super loud and very clear. It is HiFi qualito ( Google it if you don't know what it means). They are JBL speakers and there are two on the front discreetly placed.If you're looking for a budget phone that can handle a 128gb SD card and has a great screen with a price point under 200 then this is the phone. p
Phone cracks very easily, after first crack the bottom half stopped working. The first 4 days I had it the speakers didnt work so I had to factory reset it. Other than those problems, I really like the phone. Gets what I need done and the camera was great when I could use it. n
Love the sound and the pictures. Would give 5 stars, but got it to connect to my 2017 Elantra and it keeps saying my device doesn't have media. I've had it a month. Can't find the right info/person to fix the problems. It also doesn't connect to the photo kiosk at Rite Aid. It seems to have great specs. Just can't use it for what I bought it for. I feel like it shouldn't have these problems. My car rep told me it's because I use Tracfone instead of a major company like At&t or Verizon. I don't get it and have put so much time into figuring these issues out, I'm frustrated.If anyone can help, please let me know. Love the phone, just want it to connect and work. n
So far so good. Very easy to set up on AT&T. p
Amazon would not let me post my true review. :(This phone is no longer working properly after 30 days of use. Amazon will not refund the purchase price. I should be refunded the purchase price due to the product being defective. Blue screen comes on and off and does not stay connected to the Internet. I purchased two because they were cheap @ $99.99 ea. However, only one works.Filing claim with credit card company now! n
Incredible phone for the price. It has many features that no other phone has at this price point,NFC,good JBL stereo speakers and earbuds.It has a nice display 1080 p and it upgraded to Marshmallow 6.0 right away. An awesome phone for a great price. The best low price phone that I know of. p
I've had this phone for 7 months and on almost a daily basis, I exclaim "I hate this phone". I've had midrange phones before and really liked the Asus Zenfone. But the idol 3 is very slow, locks up a lot, has a lot of missing functionality that just seems like 'I can't believe you can't do that on this phone' kinda stuff. Also I was expecting a lot from the dual speakers and have been very disappointed in the sound and loudness of them. The camera is pretty dreadful, just terrible pictures and the video recorder is awful in terms of functionality. I think I'll go back to Asus when I can justify buying a new phone. Maybe I'll accidentally drop this one on concrete. n
a+ p
Very good value for the price, couldn't for more for a $100 phone. p
Bought for $132 phone design is horrible. SD and sim card slot breaks after taking it out one time. Go look at videos for installing a sim on this phone its a joke. The battery is not removable. The screen shows every finger mark. Its slow and the camera is not good either. The only thing good is that it has a full HD resolution (1080), and a large screen. The customer service for Alcatel is disgusting. The guy I was chatting to just simply ignored me, and when I tried to connect to someone who would help me it just kept redirecting me to the same guy. This phone is worth no more than $100. Overall disappointed. n
Its a good Phone for the price, I am absolutly happy with it p
Asked for refund product not working n
What can you say, it is made in China and that means GOOD REAL GOOD to me.I have several others and they are all excellent.I travel to China on vacation and I use a China Mobile Simm, no problems. GREAT PHONE.Uses AT&T and is really 4G LTE and it works great and in China is also excellent!!!!!!! p
Love It p
Bought 2x @ $199.99 pre-order price, best deal for a flagship phone. Gave them as birthday gifts to my daughters. They love it!!! Screen is bright & sharp, dual front speakers are loud and clear, both front and rear cams take good/clear pictures. Phone works great on AT&T LTE network, connection is fast for data (Youtube streaming, FB, snapchat, browsing, etc) and battery lasts all day!!! Only cons are it doesn't come with pre-installed screen protector & soft clear case (like from BLU).Overall, still 5-star rating ... p
My only gripe is the knock knock feature which sometimes doesn't work. It goes hand in hand with the reverse feature of the phone. Hopefully an update is coming soon as Alcatel now sees what problems people are experiencing.I'm getting great reception on Cricket. Battery life is amazing and the screen looks really good. Not to mention how light and thin it is. I can hold it with just a couple of fingers for a while without getting tired. I don't see much lag that some others are experiencing. This thing probably has the best speakers on a phone. I now sometimes don't even have to use my bluetooth speaker. p
Got this to replace my Galaxy S3 and I couldn't have found a better phone on my budget! Its way faster than the previous and it has an updated software! Its a gorgeous phone and worth the wait! p
This is the second alcaltel phone that I have purchased. The first was alcaltel fierce. This phone is so much better than that one. I viewed all the reviews and read all the information before purchasing the idol 3. I guess I had high expectations for this phone. After using it for a short time I felt dissatisfied with the idol 3. I felt it wasn't as good as my old phone an huawei acsend mate 2. Bottom line if I could of tried it out for a day before purchasing it would I still have bought it? I can honestly say no I wouldn't have purchased it. Is this phone a flagship killer? In my opinion no alcaltel needs to polish there product and try a little harder on there next phone. n
I got this at the current price of $250, which is still a good deal for what you get. As a T-Mobile customer, I wanted a phone that supports all the T-Mobile bands (since T-mobile coverage is not all that great as it is), which is what set this apart from the Zenfone 2. I really like the phone so far.Double tap to wake has worked for me every time. Some people have reported it not working for them all the time. It works best with the launcher it came with, so if you are using some thing else like the Nova launcher, it may not work without additional tweaks. Also remember that it needs a tap, not a gentle touch, so bend your fingers when you tap.Camera seems okay so far. Some have commented about the lack of a link to Gallery. The access to Gallery is still there. It is a little different going from Android 4 to Android 5. In 5, after you take a picture, you need to swipe from right to left to review the picture you just took. If you swipe again, you can see the previous pictures you took from Gallery.I recommend using Firefox as the browser and install an add-on like adblock to make it a little easier on the phone since the CPU in this is not the top-tier workhorse the more expensive flagship phones use. p
It's amazing for the price. Sure it isn't as fast as flagship phones being an owner of an m9, but for what I payed it's a 5/5. p
About as good value for money as there is on the current market. Lacks only a high-end processor (only important if you play demanding video games- I don't play any), and a few of those unnecessary "features" the big boys like to promote, to be equal to current flagships at almost 3x the price. Has all frequencies for AT&T and T Mobile, including LTE band 12 for the latter (which few other unlocked phones have at this point). Build quality is very good and the display is gorgeous. If you want a phablet don't even think twice, just buy it. p
For the price that the phone costs you definitely get much more than you pay for, but if you can afford to spend more, then this phone is not for you. I've had pretty much most flagship phones out there.I will start with what I dislike about the phone. 1)The lag does get annoying, but then again it is exactly the same lag that I had while using Note 4. Even galaxy s6 edge has one. I have to use those cleaning apps to free up so space in order to boost the performance. I also disabled animations in the developer mode. Still after all that, the lag is there. It is noticeable during typing when it becomes slow and keys don't register right away. 2)Next thing is battery, dies pretty quick, but even though there is no quick charge, it does charge pretty fast, on park with s6 and note 4. Battery also gets hot when using the phone with having few apps open in the background. 3) Knock knock feature doesn't work most of the time.So So things.1)Display is a hit or miss type of a thing. Colors are not as vibrant as I wish they were. Colors are a bit washed out. The screen to me does not look like it comes from a flagship phone, and it's just okay, but then again it is a $250 phone, which is what I always tell myself. I wish they gave option to adjust the tone of display in this device like samsung does. 2) This phone reminds of a nexus 6 and it's radios. LTE is here, but it's not as strong. Comparing phones side by side, s6 edge gives me speeds of download 70mb and upload of 30mb, while on idol 3 I get down 20 to 40 and upload 15 to 20ish. The speeds are okay, I have no issues with that. My issue is LTE signal is not strong, and a lot of times it drops to H+.Things I really like.1) Speaker is really good. 2) Comfortable to hold this device, and slim. 3) I think cameras are great. Way much better than Note 4, but not as good as S6 edge. 4) Charges really fast. 5) Call quality is great. 6) The size of the phone, just perfect.Overall this phone does deliver things that some even top phones don't. A lot of dislikes of mine can be fixed with a software update. For the price, it is definitely worth a buy. p
Just to be upfront I got this as a backup phone for my family to share for "just in case" moments. I got it on a pre-order one day sale of 199.00, and couldn't pass up a good deal like that. That being said, so far I'm pretty impressed. Doesn't have the best camera, but honestly its not really that bad at all-especially at the price I paid. I'm really appreciating the fact that the interface is simple and not cluttered. The settings menu is very easy to navigate, meaning it doesn't contain a bunch of crapware that no one uses or have an over done settings menu. Poor overall user experience, unwanted/unremovable carrier and OEM software, and overdone menus are contributing to dissatisfaction and to decline for some of the bigger manufacturers, but they just don't get it.The reversible phone screen feature's a cool little item also. Comes in handy when answering the phone and allows you to have your headphone jack facing the direction you want. The screen is surprisingly bright, crisp, and device seems very responsive and runs pretty smooth so far. It doesn't have all the power that my family's main phones have, but in real life use, it's powerful enough and seems to handle everything fairly well. Some little nitpicky things I don't like, and this is just me, and this is on ANY non pure Android phone, I don't like AM/PM showing on the lock screen- it just looks off centered. I also don't like AM/PM showing in the status bar. It's unnecessy visual clutter. Your common sense clues you in on the AM/PM status of the day and Google (Nexus) is the only one that gets that. Maybe at least an option to hide it. Don't like where the power or volume keys are placed, as I said earlier the camera is not the best, but for the most part it's actually not bad. I use Google's camera and edit it with Google Photos and the pictures come out pretty decent.Once encrypted you have no choice but to listen to the boot up sound not once- but twice. YAY! Great for when you turn your phone on in a quiet setting. Everyone around you is sure to appreciate the jingle and think happy thoughts. I don't know why OEM manufacturers think we need to hear boot up sounds and jingles. Decisions like this make owning a Nexus a must for me. All androids have weak and strong points, but not including the Nexus, most of them have a lot more dumb OEM annoyances that you have to deal with, but I digress. One of many of the biggest secrets to the success of the iPhone- just one. Start putting unnecessary apps from the carrier and stupid bleeps and bloops, startup sounds, etc on the iPhone and I guarantee you the complaints would come in droves. Could you imagine Verizon, AT&T or other carriers forcing apps and software on the iPhone that you couldn't remove? It would totally hurt Apple's sales and people would be in the streets with pitchforks, torches and knives... I'm digressing again.Also, the AOSP keyboard is NOT the same as the Google keyboard, at least mine isn't. Looks exactly the same, but the swype-like slide to text feature wont work for me even though I have it set properly in settings to do so. Had to actually install Google's real keyboard from the Play Store. Obviously a bug. Not a big deal, but worth noting.Besides, having Google's keyboard (or any keyboard from the store) also means it will get updated as needed from the actual store. That won't ever happen with most AOSP keyboards or OEM keyboard unless you get a system update. My keyboard having this glitch is a perfect example. It won't get fixed anytime soon.I do like the overall look of the device. It looks fairly thin and is very light. I ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a simple TPU case for it. I do like the expandable storage, I REALLY like the small bezels, I like that it doesn't have any unnecessary branding on the front of the phone, I like its simplicity, I like that it's not overdone in the software department, I like the price I paid, (although 249 is still a good deal). Really like the front facing speakers and sound. I like the double knock to turn on, which is necessary since the power button is awkward to press. I'm also impressed that the volume button presses adjust to the orientation of the screen. So volume up is always up, and down is down- regardless of orientation. The battery life is surprisingly good, and the camera is actually a bit better than I thought it would be and is more than adequate for basic use. Nice that they threw in HDR with it.I guess the only things I'm not gung-ho about is the cluttery AM/PM (as I overly mentioned), and the other items. It also charges very quickly using its own charger and cord. I used a Samsung plug on it, but it just got really warm and would barely charge, so it may be biased to its own chargers. I'm not sure how fast it would charge speed-wise with an LG, HTC, Motorola etc, or just a generic USB plugin. Anyways the charger and plug-in that it comes with appear to be very good quality. Even my teenage daughter who is always interested in the latest and greatest Android phones, thinks it's a pretty decent phone and that's saying a lot. To her at least its "not ugly looking." She actually likes the icon and UI look over her Galaxy (which is kind of fixed on Samsung by using Nova Launcher). She definitely likes that it doesn't have a bunch of applications that she has to turn off or hide, and you can actually uninstall ones you don't want. That's pretty crazy in Android world. User menu is so much easier to navigate than on her Samsung. She's not excited about the camera though. If it had the same camera and screen as the GS-6, I think she would "possibly" swap for it ;-)I'm not expecting them to update this phone in the future, although I hope that they do. I may even consider using this as a daily driver if that happens. It would be great to see this get future Lollipop updates or get updated to Android M.Overall this is a really great phone, especially for someone on a budget or someone who wants a decent Android phone that isn't going to turn them off of Android like most low in Android phones will, sending you into the arms of an iPhone in a heartbeat. Even if you're not on a budget, this still is a definte keeper. If Alcatel keeps producing phones like this, they'll be giving the high end phone market a run for their money. p
Got this phone on Friday and Iâ€™ve been using it ever since. Things that I like and things that Iâ€™ve noticed are somewhat out of place:Pros:â€¢ I love the screen. Bright, laminated, vivid. At this price point, itâ€™s truly a steal.â€¢ The speakers get surprisingly loud. At first I was worried of the vibrations they created when turned up to about 70%, but I didnâ€™t notice any distortions.â€¢ Cameras are pretty good. The focusing is on the slow side, but it usually gets it right on the first try and the exposure works well for where you tap to focus. Camera tip: to access the gallery when using the camera, just swipe left.â€¢ Battery life. I consistently get 4 to 4.5 hours of screen on time. Pretty good in my book, especially coming from a Moto X that could get 2 hours max, if I really stretched it.Cons:I will preface this by saying that I believe these are mostly software bugs that can be easily fixed with an over the air update. If anyone else has these issues or knows a fix, please feel free to comment.â€¢ For some reason unbeknownst to me, the battery screen does not show predicted battery life. On my Nexus 7, it will show the projected battery life of my device and approximately when it will reach 0% capacity. Along these lines, I also noticed that the lock screen does not show how long until the battery is fully charged.â€¢ Double tap to wake, as many others have pointed out, is gimmicky at best. When it works, which is not very often, itâ€™s great.â€¢ My mobile connection does not seem as strong as with my Moto X. The Idol 3 shows that I have no signal in many places around my home that would traditionally have at least 2 bars.â€¢ Smart Lock with the Trusted Face function does not always work. Most of the time, it is fine. But, 1 in 30 times the camera wonâ€™t even be scanning for my face and just says that it canâ€™t find my face. I go to the â€œimprove face matchingâ€ in Settings, but it still says that it â€œcouldnâ€™t find my faceâ€. I know the front facing camera is fine because it works when I use the camera app.All in all, I really enjoy this phone and, of course, it canâ€™t be beat for that price! Itâ€™s just some of these software issues are somewhat annoying, so hopefully Alcatel/Google will work on some fixes. I honestly believe that these are just bugs in Android 5.0.2 because my Nexus 7 was very sluggish with the 5.0.2 update, but immediately sped up when it received the 5.1. update. n
Do not buy this phone unless you want a phone that last 3 months the glue they used to attach the screen has weared off in 3 months so the screen is litlery pealing off my phone at this moment do not buy n
I can never seem to settle on a phone. I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy! p
For the money I think this is a pretty good phone. Screen is clear but not as good as I expected. Battery life is good. Speakers are very good and surprisingly loud and clear if needed. The one thing that really bugged me was the call quality. Not sure how I sounded to others but on my end voice quality sounded hollow and tinny and whatever I was listening to kept fading in and out. Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund. I think a better choice, in the same price range, would be the Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Bigger screen and killer battery life. For something cheaper go with BLU. p
I have been using this phone for over a month now. This phone is not a crap filled phone. It is perfect. Battery last long time. Screen is crisp and bright. Does not feel like a cheap phone in the hand. Front dual speakers are excellent and the JBL headphones are a super bonus. Phone is very responsive. My only negative issue is the tap on tap off feature that is a little quirky, but turn this feature off and its a great phone for a great price!!! p
Wonderful smarphone, i love this smarphone. p
It is a great phone, fast, decent battery life with a great screen.I don't care for the double tap on option, The phone will butt dial people when in my pocket much more often than my previous LG phone with double tap on.The stock Alcatel Android set-up needs a little maturing for my tastes, so I installed Nova launcher and am using a lock screen option.This makes the phone experience better, p
Used this phone for about 2 weeks and kind of liked as I'm not a heavy user. But some while it was in the pocket, and looks like wrong password was entered number of times or God only knows what happened. When I noticed, it was at the reset screen and phone was wiped! Then I tried to enter the information, and looks like Anti theft feature kicked in and it would not verify my Google account saying password is incorrect! Tried many time...even changed the password from the laptop, and entered on the phone, no luck! Someone mentioned after changing the password, I need to wait for 3 days....I did that, but would not cross that point! Called their support, which was poorest ever for any company which just launched a new product! They ended up saying loos like Anti theft feature is somehow locked up...and I need to ship it to the repair shop and they will see what can be done....and it might take 1-2 weeks!I rather contacted Amazon as they have excellent customer service, and they started the return process! Phone is going back tomorrow... n
I was sent a used phone. The box was not sealed and the plastic on the screen was clearly removed and reapplied. There was hair underneath it. I attempted to exchange but I was only offered a return option. The phone was sent from Alcatel so this is no fault of Amazon.The phone itself did seem to have a bit of a lag to it. I see that a lot of reviewers blame this on the specs but It's obviously something in the Alcatel skin. I'm sure a simple OTA could solve this issue. I really had no problems with the double tap feature. It worked every time for me. The screen is very nice for a $250.00 phone. It's very bright and it has very nice color. The speakers are the best feature of the phone. The sound quality of the speakers is very close to my M8. Surprisingly, the headphone jack was rather weak. I didn't try the JBL headphones but my Klipsch headphones were not that loud. My Zenfone 2 has much better headphone output.I would have liked to at least liked to try the phone for a week before giving a review but I couldn't get passed the fact they sent me a used product. I returned it after using it for an hour. I think with root and a vanilla ROM, this could be a decent phone. It has a pretty good build quality and the screen and sound beats high end flagships. It's a shame Alcatel sent me used equipment. n
I bought this phone for my wife after her screen had cracked on her her Moto G. I liked the nice specs with the affordable price. It was a good package and looked like a great phone. The screen was very nice, the battery was decent and the camera surprised us at the quality of the pictures. All was well with the Idol 3 until last week when the screen went bonkers and made the phone useless. The screen went an interesting shade of green and the icons were shadows of themselves making it impossible to use (see picture). Amazon was great and offered a full refund on the product along with the screen protectors and case we bought with the phone.We really wanted to like the Idol 3, but Alcatel needs to work on their quality of product. n
i cant say enough about this phone! EXCELLENT OVER ALL PHONE! p
Wonderful phone, I adore watching videos on it! The audio is incredible as well as the 1080p screen. The camera also makes my instagram/snapchat photos pretty sweet.ConsThe battery life is nothing to write home about seeing as it dies without light to no use at all within 6 to 7 hours. However, it does make sense as to why. Mine heats up rather quickly and I don't like not being able to take out the batteryEdit: I loved this phone but it only lasted me 10 months. It refuses to work now even after doing a reset, taking out the sim card and anything else. I've been taking good care of it; only dropped it a few times and the screen isn't even cracked. There was no water damage. I think it was the batter. What sucks is that their batteries aren't replaceable. I'm stuck in college now with no phone and 100s of miles away from home. It's not like I needed a reliable phone n
Awesome phoneðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“±ðŸ“± p
It is great!!! A wonderfull phone p
Hey guys. I wanted to wait a while to review this phone so as to give better information about how the phone held up after regular use. Sadly, I smashed the screen and had to get a new one.First things first, I am, and have always been an adroid fan. I love how Android works and have only had Android phones. I've had HTCs, LGs, a Motorola, and two Sony's. I came straight from a Samsung S6 Active to this phone in hopes that I could have the same performance that I have grown to love from Android. I must say, I am very satisfied!! This phone has been awesome! I will say that I am not a gamer and can't provide in sight to how the phone performs in that sense. But, I am a heavy user of all the Google apps, multitasking, YouTube, all that good stuff. The phone is awesome. Front facing speakers are very loud and the screen is top notch.I replaced my 5.5 in Idol 3 for the 4.7 after smashing the screen due to the price tag. I will say that I am happy with the 4.7... BUT... If you are looking to have a solid and powerful device I'd recommend paying the extra money for the 5.5. Read the specs on both and you'll see the main differences between the phones. The 4.7 is a steal of a phone. Especially in a pinch of you need a phone quick. I am convinced you will not be disappointed with it. However, the 5.5 version is just that much better. In my opinion, its the real deal and I am happy to have owned it.It's cool to see other companies producing top quality phones with the same specs as the big companies for a fraction of the price. p
Bought it as a gift. It was good for i wanna say 7 months maybe and now the problems never end. The power button got stuck somehow and you cant use it and you cant screenshot. It wore out very fast the battery life shortens very quickly. Being how many good reviews i saw for it both me and my significant other ( who has the phone ) were let down. n
Update 1: I bought my first Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 in June 2015. 6 months later it wouldn't stop shutting down. I sent it in for repair. However, they did not repair it when I got it back. I am not sure the repairman knew what he was doing. Oddly, the repairman shipped it himself to me too.Update 2: Upon writing to Alcatel through Facebook Messenger, they sent me a brand new phone. Had they not done something to make me satisfied, I would have given a scathing review of this phone. $250 might not seem like a lot, but to me it is. And I would have had to buy a new phone with a budget of probably only $50-$100. Alcatel seems like a good company. Though, they now were just bought out by Nokia.Pros:1. Price: I have had looks at my family member's Apple iPhone's and Samsung Galaxy's and they didn't seem much better than this phone in terms of speed or interface. My father's Samsung Galaxy 5 had a similar problem to mine after 1.5 years of owning it. A phone should last longer than two years in my opinion. However, even if I only get a year out of this phone, it is still a better deal than buying an iPhone or Galaxy because they are around $700-$800. So, I would only be spending $500 for two years. But then, you're in Nexus territory and that's probably a better-made phone.2. Camera: It seems really sharp to me. The ability to take HDR videos is a real plus, but the videos take up about 100 MB per minute.3. Charger: The charger is really fast. It charges in about 1-2 hours. The battery lasts for about a day if you use it a lot. If you put it on Airplane mode as I do at night, the battery goes down maybe 1-2%, which is great.4. Headphones: It comes with a pretty good set of ear-buds. They are much better quality than say a Sony pair for $20 or from the classic Apple iPods from the mid-to-late 2000's. Though, I can't say I really use them ever, because I have a good over-the-ear headphone set and a clip-on $15 one for exercising.5. Large Screen: Everyone that has seen the phone was impressed with its screen size and resolution.Cons:1. Android: I believe sometime after getting this phone, Android made it so that apps could only be stored on an SD card. I haven't completely used the 16 GB (which is really around 11 GB) in downloading apps.2. Text Messaging App: This for some reason doesn't have a "new line" button. You either have to send multiple text messages or you have to use the voice-to-text feature and say "New Line." All the other apps have a "new line" button that appears. It's a really odd gap to leave this out.3. Laggy after Booting or after Prolonged Non-Use: I didn't have this problem in other phones.which were only around $80. But upon rebooting the phone, I have type in my password. However, the keyboard lags in appearing or might not at all if you don't wait long enough for the phone to get its bearings OR the keyboard will appear and it you just won't be able to type on it. This probably happens the majority of the time.This also happens if the phone hasn't been in use for awhile like when I have it in airplane mode at night and then turn it off. This happens probably 1/3 of the time.4. Memo App: Its built-in memo app doesn't have an email function or an option to copy them to an SD card.5. Calendar-to-Map: I put in my addresses for places I need to go to for my appointments. However, if the notification for the even comes up and I click the address, it will open up Google Maps through Chrome instead of just through Maps. It's an extra step that is sort of annoying especially when driving. So, I have to make sure I am ready to go before driving basically.6. Smart Lock: Its trusted places function requires me to have do the same place multiple times if I go to a different level in my house or even a different room.Despite what other reviewers have been saying on here about Alcatel being a horrible company when it comes to customer service, I have found this not to be true so far. Even though they failed to fix my original phone, they got it back to me within a 7-day time frame from the time I sent it in to when I received it. p
I rarely give things 5-stars, but this phone is worth it. AMAZING Performance!I started using this phone 6-months ago, so I can give you a valid review over time.Why do I love this phone?- Bright display that I can read in direct sunlight. Brighter than the LGG3, HTC One, iPhone6 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4- Loud and High quality speakers! JBL stereo front facing speakers and JBL headphones.- Excellent Camera! 13mp camera is by Sony.- "Reversible Interface" First phone to offer this feature. The screen orients right-side-up even when you turn the phone upside-down, so the phone is never upside-down- Great battery life; I can Facebook and chat all day on one charge.- Easy to manage and close running applicationsWhat I don't really like about the phone?- Slippery and easy to drop without a case.- Not many cases available. p
Lots of folks have posted glowing reviews of this phone, so I will simply say that I also love this phone for the same reasons everyone else loves it. It's a fantastic value. But the primary reason I was shopping for a new phone was that my previous phone had an unreliable GPS unit. I couldn't find much commentary on the GPS unit on the Alcatel but there were some hints that it might be better, so I took a chance. I like to use the phone with the Ramblr app to create GPS tracks of hikes. With my previous phone it would take a long time (five minutes was not unusual) to get a satellite fix so I could start the track. And then the phone would give me bad points occasionally, sometimes freezing at a point in the middle of the hike, requiring extensive editing after the hike to correct the trail. I needed a phone with a better GPS unit, and I found it in the Alcatel One Touch Idol 3! The GPS on this phone just works! Satellite fix at the start of the hike takes just a few seconds, and the track continues flawlessly throughout the hike. If you're looking for an Android phone with a reliable GPS unit, this unit should do a fine job for you. p
This phone is awesome!! The display is bright and clear, the sound is fantastic. Internet connection also great. I use straight talk and have no problems. Buy this phone. p
Price and quality: super p
Is an acceptable phone considering it costs about 140 dollarsOctacoreNice speakers (JBL)Acceptable screen.Android 6I havethis phone about a month, and restart only once. I don't know what will happen in the future, but is enough phone for me. p
This phone failed 34 days after my order. I have no recourse to return based on the 30 day policy. There is not even a clear ability to communicate to Amazon about this.This is an unfortunate customer service issueWould not purchase again n
Marvelous screen, camera, speaker sound. p
I have been using it for only a couple of weeks and it is working quite nicely. A great improvement from my previous Alcatel phone. I only wish there were a phone with the same specifications in a smaller size, like a 5" or less. I was torn between this one and the ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD. However, this one is much better in all aspects except size. So, it is a compromise for me.If it weren't for that I would probably be closer to 5 stars. p
I was not really expecting much for the price I paid, $100.I have no complaints. It meets my budget and my needs. p
I have had this phone close to a month now I am beyond impressed. I will never buy a $400-700 phone again as long as this company is making quality phones for a reasonable price. p
I LIKE THE PHONE L OUT A lot p
The phone has everything I need at an irresistible price !! The signal is very strong when I'm in places that did not have any sign ... Camera is decent...sound incredible !! I do not play with cell so the battery lasts me two days !! The connectivities WiFi and all are very good !! p
Great alternative phone for teens instead of far more expensive ones. Works with AT&T 4Glte p
Love this phone. Fairly quick page loading, handles as many apps as you want ( currently 40+ and counting). little to no bloatware, good Bluetooth range, and great speakers. Video quality and sound quality is way above average streaming video and music. I can only see two small drawbacks and one may never be a drawback, only a foreseeable one.One is that the battery is not removable. I have had a phone that would not shut off, with the "Read It to Me" app running, reading off text messages with the only alternative to remove the battery to stop it.The other difficulty with this phone is it's dual sim, sd card tray. You must use a little tool to get it out. Then you must balance the chips on the tray and slide it in. So if you tremble then inserting the chips would seem to be impossible to me! I lost a sim chip when pulling the tray out and the chip flying off the tray into the trash.All in all, this is hands down the best phone that I have ever owned. I highly recommend this to any android phone user. I also recommend buying a case and screen protector with your purchase. I have read several other reviews that said it is very fragile. But most phones are fragile in my opinion!One other thing to consider is that this phone runs on Android 6.0.1 so if you want the newest operating system (Marshmallow or better) then don't buy this phone. I have not researched it yet but there may be ways to upgrade the o.s. on this phone p
I came to this phone from using a Nexus 4 for the last two and a half years and my initial impressions were very mixed. Starting with the positive things, I love the LTE, the bigger and more color accurate screen, the battery life, the expandable storage, the dual front facing speakers, and how light it is and how thin it is. All big improvements! I also appreciate the very light touch Alcatel used with their skin on Android. It's almost stock.So many great things and yet it was almost all brought down by an Achilles heel. The thing that really bugged me was that moving in and out of apps was really sluggish and choppy and not smooth at all. All of these things are super smooth on the Nexus 4, which is a 2012 phone. Even swipe typing on Google Keyboard was not great. I came pretty close to sending it back and getting a new Moto G.(I have no proof of this, but my guess is that the phone sends almost all of its processes to the slower of the two chipsets in the Snapdragon 615, the one clocked at 1ghz. Unfortunately there's no "high performance" option anywhere that would make everything run on the 1.5ghz chipset. The Nexus 4 proves this is plenty to run Android smoothly.)I didn't want to get a Moto G, especially after seeing (and hearing, seriously those speakers are great) this phone. Thankfully, Android is a pretty flexible OS and I was able to take matters into my own hands and make things more palatable. First thing I did was turn all animations off in the developer options. Second thing I did was I installed Nova launcher and selected the options to make things run "faster than light." Everything is MUCH smoother after doing those two things. Still not quite as smooth as the Nexus 4, but probably 95% of the way there. Close enough where I can deal with it and I can enjoy the good things about the phone that I admittedly skimped on in the first paragraph.So I really like this phone now. It's everything I wanted. It just took some tinkering to get there. p
Worst phone ever. I have just got it for 7 days. Somehow there is scratch on the touch screen. I for sure did not drop it. Or perhaps I pressed on the screen too hard? Then the touch screen is totally doomed. I think they just used regular glass. I had HTC M8 before, which was dropped out of hand a few times but there was never a scratch on the screen. Quality of the cell phone is a big concern. The cell phone gets heated very quickly after playing a small game or chatting for over 10 minutes. n
Gps problems, everything else is great, but it can't lock gps position to save it's life. Constantly says gps signal lost n
This Smartphone has met My expectations and then some. It is extremely fast and does what it says, this was a upgrade from My last Alcatel, it was well worth the money when considering other high end Smartphones. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to upgrade without the big price tag. 5 Stars To Alcatel.!!! p
Excellent p
Crear productos. p
This is a great phone. Sound Quality is great, the stripped down Android OS was perfect for me as I am a programmer and am making my own apps on the device. The drivers being built into the phone is a cool feature. The flip around feature on the phone is fun to use at parties. Battery life is about a day of heavy use. The only real drawbacks of the phone have been the inability to disassemble the phone without voiding the warranty. I'd give this phone 5 stars if it were able to be taken apart to replace the battery easily. p
This phone sounds great and feels great. I wish the text messaging app was better and I don't like the placement of the power button. Those are small issues that I can deal with. The best phone around for $249. p
This phone so far has been a good mix between value, design and performance. I can only hope that Alcatel continues building a budget/ performance friendly phone for the Android OS. p
I did a lot of research and video review watching about this phone before buying it. I'm very glad I did. For a company known for making terrible phones this phone is Dynamite. It's quick, responsive and best of all come with no bloatware.The speakers are amazing and even when bluetooth ed the sound is great.I definitely recommend putting a silicone cover on it. The phone is very slippery without it.The only downfall was that it did go haywire once requiring it to be hard restarted and all the dates were changed to 1970.I love this phone and hope it last a long time. p
I absolutely love this phone. Great performance, UI, very sleek and the dual speakers on the front produce high-quality sound for their size.Most importantly for me and also the reason I recommend this phone to everyone is the outstanding price. Priced at $250 I was able to purchase a 64gb microSD card and a quality case while remaining under my budget of $300. I know some people would prefer the smaller version (4.7"), and it has an even better pricetag at $180.Some flaws would be lack of mobile service providers (Verizon, Sprint) and the inability to access the photo gallery through the camera app, which has been a standard feature of most phones for quite some time now.For me these drawbacks don't impact the overall score of this phone. I had to switch from Verizon to t-mobile, but have had better coverage and a smaller bill as a result. I could see the camera / gallery issue being a nuisance to some people but to me it's a very minor inconvenience.Overall this phone has much to offer. For music fans it has even more to offer, including a turntables feature built-in to the music player allowing you to crossfade between your songs.Strongly consider the Alcatel OneTouch idol 3 if you're searching for a high quality no-contract phone for an exceptional price. p
Very good budget phone, love it. p
Excellent product. Friendly, versatile, fast, very good pictutes and what a sound! And charge very fast! I love it! The performance can get improved p
Well, I had this phone for a bit so I guess its time for a review.The good--Looks nice-Feels nice in hand-The audio quality is actually pretty awesome-Screen is pretty goodThe bad--Battery life is average at best-Switching the power/volume button sides from the norm- I thought I would get used to it, after months still not so and it gets annoying-Crashes/locks up at least once a day-The speakers collect a ton of pocket debris-Somewhat slow to charge using any charger including a 2.4a fast charger- ~75% of the time when I answer my phone the speaker phone is active but not showing so in the UI. I have to toggle it on, then off again to get it to normal. SUPER annoying when you hold a phone with speakers this loud to your ear and someone starts talking. I never use speaker phone or a headset so it has nothing to do with anything but the phone.-This is Alcatel's best and they can't give it Gorilla Glass or comparable? This thing is fragile. Mine slipped off the kitchen counter and landed in a bowl of crunchy dog food and shattered. Yes, I had it in a case. The way the screen sticks out a bit seems to make it a magnet for breakage according to me and what looks like a lot of other people.-Price There seems to be a lot of pretty nice what I would call secondary brand Androids coming out lately. Many of them at this price point and some even lower. This phone is probably $50-$75 more than it should be right now.In conclusion-Do your shopping and comparing wisely. I would bet that most of you reading this review are like me, tired of paying $600+ for Samsung or Apple phones that are also locked. While this and no other phones at this price are, or compare to those brands, I enjoy the savings and my new found freedom. This phone doesn't compare to my Note 4, nor did I expect it to. Also, the truth is that I don't really miss my Note. 95% of the features that made the note so awesome got turned off by me anyhow. I don't use NFC, face tracking, eye scrolling etc. I literally never even used the S-pen. What I did use- this phone has, but so do a lot of reasonably prices phones now. I'm not necessarily saying don't buy it, you might love it. Just make sure you know your options and if you choose this- DON'T DROP IT lol. n
GREAT PHONE, SUPER CAMERAHOWEVER, BATTERY LIFE IS HORRIBLE, HAVE TO CHARGE IT TWICE A DAY EVEN WHEN I DON'T USE p
Great phone. Supports T-Mobile band 12. Premium phone at a bargain price. p
I've had this for about 3 months now. Coming from an HTC 1S. This is an awesome phone once you replace a few apps. The camera app is so so. I switched to Camera 360. Google camera is also decent. Huge difference. The launcher is ok, but I highly recommend switching to Nova free or some other highly reviewed launcher like Action, Go etc.. Another huge difference can be realized by installing DU Battery Saver. Do these three things and you will have a great phone that has incredible audio, very good camera, and superb battery life. I used to go down to about 30% at the end of the day with my HTC and about 35-45% with this phone until I installed DU battery saver. Now I'm at about 50 to as high as 70% at the end of the day. I recommended my daughter install this on her LG G4. She said she already had it and it didn't help much so this may be phone dependent. I'm not a shill for this app just know it works great with this phone. I really like the fact that it doesn't come pre-installed with much bloatware, and the fact that you can uninstall almost all of it if you want. An absolutely great deal at this price. It's not even debatable. Pay $250 and avoid the provider contracts. You won't be disappointed. Also, their customer service is great. T-Mobile accidentally deactivated my ESN and killed my phone. I had to send it in for repair. They received it Monday, and shipped it back out Tuesday, and I received it Thursday. p
It's overall a great device for the price especiallyThe price. Front facing speakers always recommend on a phone, Display you really can'tTell the difference. I've seen great full HD screens and some 720p. Don't be a display snobIf you can't afford a higher end device. Definite buy in my book, make sure you get a case and temper glass and I've heard stories about how soft the materials are on the idol3. p
Excellent, very good investment. p
Like the phone a lot. Decent battery, fast enough, good stock Android. Can't beat the price for what you get. p
for the price I don't think you can beat it. It stutters opening video and audio and the HDR sometimes leaves artifacts, but the screen, speakers, and camera are overall very decent. Battery life is very good.Since the software update it hasn't had the stuttering issue. I sent mine in with a broken digitizer and Alcatel sent it back for days later fixed. All I paid was shipping. p
Phone appears to perform well, be careful not to over drive the JBL speakers - they can usually not take full volume playing media.The issue with this phone is the yellowish tint screen, common on low-end phones. Alcatel please explain this. Update - Yellow screen is caused by screen adhesive not properly cured / aged before shipment. The phone appears to be moving toward proper hue with use. Obviously, these great phones were shipped out as soon as the boxes were sealed. p
The phone itself is great for the price but... it randomly drops signal completely and does not regain signal for several minutes at a time. It is also laggy when browsing the web, taking several seconds to respond. With the specs considered, this phone should not have lagging problems, so hopefully they will be releasing a software update to fix this at some point. n
I'll spare the specs--they're easily found elsewhere. The phone's design, however, is of a very well balanced upper-mid range telephone for a lower-mid level price. The sound is fantastic, it has great cameras and the radio will communicate on every T-Mobile and AT&T frequency band in the US (which should include providers that use AT&T or T-Mobile's underlying networks). For T-Mobile customers, the LTE Band 12 (700 MHz) indeed penetrates buildings like only AT&T customers previously enjoyed, when in enable US locations (search for T-Mobile 700 Mhz for more details). The updated radio and being designed for Android version 5 makes this phone more than just a cheaper version of the previous generation's phone, but instead a modern phone albeit a bit easy on the computing horsepower. If you need top processing power, look to the big names' flagship phones; otherwise the Idol 3 will likely fill any other needs (but consider adding an SD Card if you have a lot of media or photos) p
My TakeHere's my take on this phone. I had an HTC 816 on Virgin Mobile. I was very happy with the phone, but looking to get away from the VM service which was spotty in key locations for me. I sold my HTC as soon as this was announced and switched to Cricket with a Lumia 635 to hold me over until this arrived. I did not like the 635 one bit, and I became increasingly anxious for this phone to be delivered. I watched and read all the reviews to hold me over. I got the phone delivered swapped my sim and was up and running in less than 10 minutes. It was a busy holiday weekend with my family, including lots of driving so I didn't get to play with this as much as I would have liked, but I'm finally getting it fully optimized today. I paid $199 for this phone and feel it was an exceptional value. I love the size and ordered a slim case from China ($4 and delivered less than 2 weeks) to protect the edges without adding significant bulk.Here's here I felt this phone met my expectations-1- Battery life seems great so far, enough for 1 day of moderate usage. It seems to be getting better after each charge.2- Display and sound are as advertised and satisfactory in my opinion.3- Phone doesn't seem laggy with normal app usage and video watching. I'm not a gamer so I can't speak for that.4- Look and feel of phone is excellent. The build quality is nice, and doesn't feel any different from a "true flagship" with my slim skin on.Here's a couple minor quirks that I didn't love-1- reversible mode sounded cool in theory, but I disabled as I found it silly based on my own preferences.2- Double tap to wake was a little tricky, and I found my phone had awaken in my pocket a few times and opened up apps. I disabled and went back to using power button.All-in-all, I love this phone and think I will grow to enjoy it more as I get more used to it. I use with Cricket wireless service (on AT&T network) and it seems to work flawlessly. Good luck selecting the right phone for you. p
my impressions after 3 days:positives:1. great battery life. i would guess 6+ hours screen time easy.2. speakers are absolutely awesome.3. the screen is excellent and very bright. wish we could reduce the brightness (might give longer battery life to boot!).4. no problems with wifi or other things like heat etc.5. user experience is fast enough - better than nexus 4.6. good build quality.negatives:1. camera (ok for the money).2. need unlocked boot loader and root desperately. alcatel needs to realize who their customers are (i.e., what type of people buy their phones!) and provide what they need.biggest negative (unacceptable!):1. tmobile reception is like approx 10dBm lower than nexus 4 overall. where signal is poor, i used to get LTE with nexus 4, but now I can't. IMHO, this is a deal breaker for me. seriously thinking on returning this :(.Added image with both phones side by side. The image is from a place where I have excellent reception. From a place where I have poor reception, the nexus 4 has strength approx -108dBm and holds LTE, but idol 3 is less than -120dBm and cannot hold LTE and reverts to HSPA/UMTS.other:antutu 64bit score is ~33000. n
I preface this review by noting that (1) I rarely write product reviews, and (2) I only had this phone for a day so far. With these disclaimers out of the way, I'm simply amazed at the quality and features of this device. Coming from an LG Optimus G and a Fire Phone, the Alcatel Idol 3 is miles and miles better than either device - especially the Fire with its gimped UI and other gimmicks.Amongst the standout features are the high-quality screen, front-facing speakers, and its overall compact size. Alcatel has accomplished quite an engineering feat here by squeezing a huge screen and battery into a package barely larger than 4.7 inch phones out there. This device is also incredibly lightweight at around 140g and, just as important, the weight is evenly distributed. Coming from a 4.7 inch screen devices, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon...As for the software and other features, I'm happy to report it runs an almost flavor of Android 5.0 (Lollipop). The performance is snappy despite featuring a mid-level chipset in the Snapdragon 615; likewise the camera looks good with only the autofocus being a bit slow. It includes a microSD slot so you can add additional memory cards if necessary. I should mention that it takes microSIM-sized cards in case you're switching from a phone that takes a different form factor of SIM. Last but not least, I use T-Mobile as my carrier and have not fallen off the LTE speed band yet (in the DC area).All in all, I think this is a no-brainer for anyone looking for a new Android phone with a large screen. I spent a lot of time researching prior to making this purchase, especially comparing this to the Asus Zenfone 2, and this Idol 3 won out in the end. Aside from the attractive price and features as mentioned, I have to highlight that this phone includes the LTE Band 12. Band 12 is used exclusively by T-Mobile in the U.S. and supposedly allows better indoor penetration and network reception. Something to keep in mind if you're looking to switch to or currently have T-Mobile, since very phones today have this - the Asus Zenfone 2 certainly does not. p
Beautiful phone at an incredible price point. The display is bright and vibrant; images really pop out at you. The 5.5" screen makes the phone very easy to use and text is crystal clear. The 1080P screen is simply beautiful. It almost goes edge-to-edge as well - not a lot of wasted space. The octa-core processor makes it extremely responsive, almost instantaneously doing whatever you tell it to do. The rear camera is 13 megapixel, although it is 4:3 at that quality. I leave it on 10MP (16:9) and the photos it takes are magnificent. The stereo speakers on the front, powered by JBL, are really good too. The phone is light, and thin, making it easy to handle and store. TLDR: Amazing phone at an affordable price. p
Best phone I have ever had. In my life I have owned iphone 3gs, iphone 4, and samsung galaxy s3. All overpriced.Huge HD screen, amazing battery life-- lasts the entire day. New name brand phones just aren't worth it anymore. You are practically just paying for a name. I don't care for the latest and fastest phone, because it's just a phone. Definitely never going back unless this thing craps out on me prematurely. Will update if that happens. p
For $250, this is as close to $600 flagship you will ever get. The SD615 isn't quite as fast as the 801 in OPO, but it is close and Chrome runs about the same speed. 6hrs screen on and two more hours blasting the speakers before the battery got to 8%. Tmob reception is better than the OPO by 1.5 bars most of the time. The speakers... omg just awesome full deep sound, focus more on the bass but i prefer that. The build, it is so light and thin i forget it is in my pocket. the brushed plastic on the back feels nice to hold, doesn't attract fingerprints. i was afraid the Dragontrail glass would be a fingerprint magnet, but no it isn't. its been a long time since i had a phone with an FM tuner on it... they need to bring this back. even with music freedom on tmob, using the FM radio uses far far less battery than music streaming. oh and the screen... had one guy say, wow that screen looks great, nuff said with the high brightness and deep blacks, looks like an OLED panel tbh.Cons: hard to think of one, side bezels are so thin expect unauthorized tap registers when holding it tight. forget about using it with one hand. so thin and light it does feel rather... like it needs a case.Verdict = if you don't buy flagships, get this phone. p
Great phone so far. Still relearning Android phones after years with a Windows phone. Will have to update review at a later date. p
Awesome phone p
Love it.. p
Increible :D p
Good p
VERY IMPRESSIVE PHONE, AND THE BIGGER SCREEN AND 1080 DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD. PROBABLY THE BEST SOUNDING PHONE IVE EVER HEARD WITH ITS JBL SPEAKER SYSTEM. p
good phone great price i am happy p
love it, only wish the battery was removable however it works very well. and shipping was very quick p
Very good phone. Price can't be beat for what you get. Should've bought two. p
My son asked me to order this particular phone for him. He is very happy with it. He had done researches on phone before deciding on this one. He is thrilled that the phone is exactly what he expected. p
UPDATED REVIEW:The phone was repaired, without any problems, and it works perfectly again. The repair center was in Dallas, TX, and they did a good job, in just a few days. The hardest part was filling in the form on their website: getting the IMEI off the phone, getting the proof of purchase, and selecting the proper fields for the issue.This is truly an awesome phone.Now I notice the price has gone down since we bought it, so anybody who wants an Android phone at 5" or bigger has NO reason to ignore this. At this point, it cannot be beaten for the price (even if, like mine, the networking chip dies and you have to send it off for repair).ORIGINAL REVIEW:I wanted to give 5 stars for this, since it has performed nearly perfectly for the past 2 months. And for the price, this has been the best 5.5" phone value available anywhere.But sadly, I am worried about the build quality of these phones. Today I woke up, and after 2 months of use, the SIM card is not recognized, and the Wifi is completely dead. The phone has no networking support at all.It seems to be a hardware problem, as I have tried the SIM in another phone and it works fine, and removed SD and SIM, and done factory reset, and the problem is the same. It starts to feel hot on the back, and it will even reboot itself after trying to scan for available Wifi networks when switching the Wifi off and on again.Since Amazon only allows 30 days for returns, I have to figure out how to return it to Alcatel (I hope I can return it after just 2 months). I have another Idol 3 phone, the 4.7", and it's slightly less than 2 months old. Please wish me luck that this doesn't happen again, and I can get this broken one replaced. p
This is a very good phone for a reasonable price. I didn't realize the size I was buying (I thought it was the smaller version), so I'm disappointed with the size. Aside from that, the phone performs admirably, and it's recently been updated with Marshmallow (Android v6).I have experienced some quirks with the phone. The screen sometimes shuts off in the middle of inputting my PIN as though the device were inactive. I have to open it again and start entering the PIN again. The Marshmallow update fixed a problem with the Play Music app, which would lock the phone when starting the app. I had to open the phone, swipe, re-enter the PIN, unlock and then I could actually use the app. As you can imagine, this was very annoying, but it's thankfully fixed with Marshmallow. The first problem persists, though it doesn't happen too often.Reception is good. Battery life is good (for my use, anyway). Screen quality and brightness are good. The interface is a bit awkward because of the phone's large size and button placements. It's a little unwieldy to reach the volume buttons and the power button is tougher. Camera quality is reasonable in good light, but overall it's a poor substitute for a decent camera (or even an iPhone, really). Speakers are very good, stereo, and loud.I probably wouldn't buy it again but only because of its large size. If that doesn't bother you, this is a very good buy. p
Perfect! p
The speakers are great.2 bad sides are that the screen is humped over the speakers so the screen would get scratched easily. The second is that when switching from earpiece to speakerphone, there is a 10 second blank delay where you can't hear the other person, but they can hear you. p
Great phone! Great battery! Highly recommend. Don't buy cheap Chinese brands. I bought 2 chinese brands from amazon and one lasted one year, the other only a few months. Buy the Alcatel. p
I will start off by saying this phone has been excellent and worked flawlessly until recently. I have had the phone for about 4 months now, and it has been inside a case. The power button has stopped functioning correctly. I can still feel mechanical action of the button functioning correctly, but the button is not working electrically possibly due to a broken solder joint. I say this because I get occasional functionality if I press the button to the point that it feels like it will break the phone, and when this works the screen may flash on and off three times as if it was electrically connected three times.Alcatel's support / warranty requires the owner to pay for shipping to and from their facility, leaving the owner without a phone for the duration of shipping+repairs. This level of support for a broken phone under warranty is unacceptable. n
Very happy with the Alcatel Idol, it meets all my needs. It's a very SMART phone. The only downside is a non replaceable battery. By the time it would need a new battery, it's time to upgrade the phone. p
I have a Cricket Wireless sim card and I was looking for a nice phone to use it in. I have had several Blu phones but they seem to be quirky, never get upgraded to the latest operating system and their customer service is bad.I discovered that this Alcatel was a unlocked smartphone and gave it a try. I was impressed as soon as I opened the box! This phone has a 5.5" screen, same as my old phone, and felt great in my hands.The reception is great and I usually get an LTE signal out here in the corn fields. The JBL speakers are outstanding! They are placed in the front of the phone, one at the top and the other at the bottom. It is great hearing bass when streaming a movie. The only problem with the speakers is that I can not get them turned down just one more notch. The lowest setting is pretty loud and I have tried all the sound settings in the phone. This is my only pet peeve.The phone updated some Alcatel settings as soon as I turned it on then updated its self to Marshmallow right afterwards. There is very little bloatware which is great. You can add a mini SD card and you have a choice between leaving it as is or you can have the phone include the mini SD card into internal memory. You can have 32gb plus what ever you add with a mini card. I added a 32gb mini SD card so now I have 64gb of internal memory.This phone also has NFC which can be used in many ways. Very few smartphone in this price range have NFC.For the price and features, this Alcatel can not be beat! p
Had to return. Some issues n
I bought it for my husband and he loves it. Quite big for every day use but excellent for its price. p
I am so loving this phone a lot! Especially now that it has Marshmallow. Great battery life! The front facing speakers make watching videos and playing games an enjoyable experience. It's 5.5" screen along with its resolution make the experience even better. Its not up to par with flagship phones but coming from an entry level phone this product is excellent! It does have little lags here and there but its not a bid deal. These minor hiccups I can live with. 2Gb ram really makes it work faster and multi tasking is a breeze if you don't have a lot of apps open. I am not a heavy app user so I don't have a lot of apps on my phone so the 11 gb memory is sufficient for me.I would highly recommend this product! p
Forget liking this device I Love It. The sound from the front facing stereo speakers are amazing. No need for separate Bluetooth speakers anymore. The 5.5in LCD screen is pretty amazing. I personally prefer amoled/oled screens but in comparison this screen holds it own. The camera is pretty basic but can produce some great shots in auto mode as well with manual controls. Very thin and light to the point that it feels like maybe the battery is missing or that this is a demo/dummy phone with no guts. Very durable though as tested by accident when the kids dropped the phone and it slid across the tiled kitchen floor on its screen and showed no signs of damage without screen protector applied or case on it. Do wish that the company included a clear case though. Usb type c and water resistant are on my wish list too. p
I have had the Idol 3 for 3 days now and I am in love with it! I was a windows phone user before, first time using an android phone in fact, and I love it. The battery works pretty good, I consider myself a heavy user and the battery lasted one whole day, that never happened with my lumia.The camera works pretty well too, I thought I would worry about the size since my hands arent that big, but no issue! The design is just perfect, I like it very much.I missed the LED light too! My lumia didnt have it either. If you usually watch vids or play games, nothing better than the idol 3. The speakers and the size screen are excellent! I just watched a movie with the phone and everything went very well!I just cant wait to order my case, there are no cases in my country for this phone, and I am disaster! lolIf anything happens, I will update.Overall: Excellent phone for an excellent price! Nothing to regret. p
Very good phone but when I got the case I had the phone in my pocket while riding my bike it came out fell to the ground and broke the screen p
First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didnâ€™t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didnâ€™t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isnâ€™t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts donâ€™t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the â€œenhanced 4G LTEâ€ setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the â€œcoolerâ€ side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to â€œautoâ€ when you go into an extremely bright or dark area. p
buy mobile to you, but I do not work 3G band is only 2G and LTE, also does not come with the onetouch stream. n
I paid $99 here on Amazon and honestly not sure how anyone is staying in business for these specs at that price. The only thing really lacking is a gyroscope but for the price I can't really complain that it's missing. This is loaded with android 6.0.1, everything seems really snappy. This is the first phone I've used with soft keys and it's not bad. The front facing speakers are surprisingly good. However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume. I'd advise turning off the JBL special effects otherwise you'll end up with muddled music that is overly bassy, Although maybe you'll like it. The key is that you can atleast toggle this feature on or off depending on your taste.Pros:Nice screen sizePleasant designFront facing speakers sound really great (but will sound distorted at max volume)Speaker and microphone on both sides so you can answer/talk no matter which orientation you have the phone.Micro SD storageLong lasting batteryScreen will work in any orientation (nice for when you want to have the charging cable on the top vs bottom while in the car)Con:No gyroscope p
Hi.The description of the product say: Is global unlocked and can use in 4LTE but it doesnt work, If you can help me I'll really appreciate that.Anything else is ok.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty) n
A great phone but I spend way too much on other accessories which had me throwing it away in the trash. p
Really good phone for the price ($99.99) the phone works well and I am very satisfied with my purchase. The phone has 13mp back camera and it can shoot 1080p HD videos. My service provider is Metro PCS and they were able to activate my phone without any trouble. However I paid a $25 activation fee because I had to purchase a new sim card. Overall i am happy with the phone and i hope it will last a while. p
I am kicking myself for buying this phone. All I really wanted was a phone to make calls,txt,and use a few apps. Not a heavy user.PROBLEMS started after the 15 day return policy. My reception was poor to say the least. At home my wife's Apple 4 was getting 3 bars and no reception problems. Sometimes I would get 3 bars but mostly "no service" or "emergency only". So I buy a signal booster for the house...great for my wife, no help for me. Next the pattern swipe for access doesn't work. You end up calling Mexico for help and they want you to go thru "factory reset". So I do...3 times. I still have failure of pattern swipe again and the reception hasn't improved. Now they want it back to fix or replace so I'm without a phone while they diddle around with it. If you're thinking about buying this phone....keep thinking! n
Great phone, first thing I did was update it which took about 20 minutes, it was well worth the wait. There was a lot of lag at first but after the setup everything was smooth. Then I installed my 64 GB SD card and off loaded all the apps I can while setting my camera, voice recorder and music defaults to the SD card ( 16 GBs with only 10 free is pretty low now a days) so with all my apps and cashe totals to about 3.5 gbs combined with 6.5 ish to spare on the phone for apps that can't be off loaded to the SD card.The build reminds me of a better thought out Samsung s4, screen is awesome coming from a flagship HTC m8 and speakers are on par! The plastic build has some defects on the corners, some paint imperfection but you really had to look for it. Peformance wise I didn't noticed much from my HTC m8 I would say I'm not hard core on my mobile devices, just social, YouTube, some games and lot of web browsing. The nice touches of reversibility and double tap to wake are great additions and make a lot of sense ( although I forget its hard to take a picture upside down ). Almost stock android is a delight to use, at first I was so dumbfounded on how much less I had to do to set up the device, which caused me to stare at it and wonder what esle to do.Over all I would give it a 4.5 just because of the small defects in the paint, never the less an awesome phone for the price. p
Tells me emegency calls for no reason n
So far I like it very much! p
This item was damaged really bad I ended up having to pay for repairs...this wasn't a good buy on my end....in case your wondering the screen fell off the device. n
I really, really wanted to love this phone. I mean, what more could you ask for?! Super thin and light. Stereo front facing speakers with amazing sound quality. Full HD screen both bright and crisp. Nearly pure version of Android Lollipop. Respectable battery life. JBL headset IN THE BOX. Attractive looks that are just enough different from the crowd for people to ask, "hey, what kind of phone is THAT?"Sounds great, right? The problem for me is two-fold. 1) There are only 11 GB of available storage on the phone, which is really, really small. Well, you say, that shouldn't be a problem because it supports Micro SD cards up to 128GB, right? 2) Yes, it does support Micro SD cards but the implementation is almost unusable.You cannot move apps from the phone to the SD card, really. Oh, you have the option in Application Manager to "Move to SD Card" but because of the way they've made the filesystem, you only have the ILLUSION of the app actually moving. Move an APP and then go look at the SD Card in File Manager, and you find that NOTHING actually moved.Further, some apps (like Amazon Music) which allow for selecting where files should go, only recognize the SD card SOME of the time. Other times, nada. Also, sometime the SD card wouldn't mount, leaving lots of missed apps and files (even though the apps aren't actually ON the SD Card).Last complaint: Wifi reception and speeds were sketchy compared to all the other devices in my house.In the end, I sent this phone back and bought a used Note 4. I guess $250 is just a little TOO LITTLE to charge for a phone. n
First let me tell you that I spend a lot of time reading reviews and on tech sites and am usually the guy in the family that everyone asks for tech advice.After my Nexus 5 screen shattered I was not happy with the state of any of the higher end android phones. They were just too expensive and big. SO after much research i settled on the Idol 3 after reading tons of great reviews.DESIGN: The phone is thin and sleek. I quite like the plastic back. It has a nice feel to it. There's not much flair to the phone but I personally like that. Its a little big and maybe a tad uncomfortable to hold because of how thin is it. The front has two front facing speakers, and there's a notification light up front. The tray that holds the sim card also has a place for you to put in a micro sd card.Camera: Right off the bat I have to tell you that the camera BLEW ME AWAY. In auto mode you get some very good images, but the camera comes in full manual mode that lets you adjust ISO, shutter speed, focus, and white balance. I've gotten some AMAZING images from this phone. Its probably the phone's most under appreciated feature. The camera has other modes, but I almost never touch them.Battery: The battery for me on this phone easily last a day, and with light use will last 2. I can't tell you how nice it is not having to worry if i remembered to pack my charger all the time.Screen: The screen is nice and bright, colors nice and sharp. Its not the sharpest, but its a great screen, and better than most in this price range.Software: The phone comes with almost stock android. The minor changes are generally useful, like letting you restart the phone and put it in airplane mode from the power button (which annoyingly google too out of stock android). Alcatel has not been the best about software updates, but they have been really good about security updates. Since i've own the phone there have been two security updates. This is good! Most cheap phones never even see these.Performance: This is really the only place that the phone falters. Games take a while to open, and if you have too many apps or tabs open, the phone really starts to get sluggish. About once a day I end up closing all apps to release some ram. This generally helps, but sometimes I end up having to restart the phone to get it back. That being said most apps are fine. Apps like facebook or twitter don't have any hang ups.Overall, this phone is such a good value. Except for maybe being a tad too big, and sometimes sluggish performance with more graphic intensive games, this phone is a joy to use. In many ways it best phones costing 3 times as much. p
I got a crappy phone which did not work after one hour of use . n
The screen is very good and so are the speakers. The battery life is good as well. The phones weakest points are build quality and performance. It became frustrafing to use. The phone itself looks great but the speaker and screen had some movement. It seemed separated. n
I've been using this phone for a month with T-Mobile. I haven't had any problems with it. It has a great display, great sound and great connectivity. It fits well in my hand, call quality is excellent. I also use it with Ooma's app to make calls over wifi and that works great too. You'll need to be an Ooma customer to use that. I put a 128GB micro sd card in it, that's pretty well loaded with video and music. It doesn't seem to drag performance. I moved what apps allow it to the card. It's a great phone if you watch a lot of video whether it's streaming or using internal storage. I had considered the Moto G until I found out it didn't support wireless display. I had doubts about Alcatel, but this phone has turned out to be superb. The only thing I don't like about it is the button and usb port placement. p
Got this to compare with my OnePlus 1 & Asus Zenfone 2 with 4GB. Overall I'm very impressed. Looks wise I'd rate it about equal to the 1 & better than the zenfone 2.Powerwise the Asus & OnePlus both score better than the Idol 3 & yes I to sometimes notice some lag from time to time. The screen & speakers on the Idol 3 are better than both Oneplus 1 way brighter/louder/better than the Zenfone. As the pro reviews have said it isn't easy to see the Zenfone screen in the sun & here in Texas we have a lot of sun. However the Asus is a super game playing device where I'd advise gamers to avoid the Idol 3. It is great with most everyday tasks like e-mail, messaging, phone calls, & web browsing. Camera-wise the OnePlus (esp video) & Asus 1 are a bit better than the Idol 3 but all three, camera-wise are a good bit below the Apple 6 phones or Samsung S6 amoung others, but for their price they're pretty good. Over all I think the OnePlus 1 is slightly better than this Alcatel Idol 3 but the Asus is the best cheap game phone around. Just use a IEM/headphone for games& music with it 'cause the Asus speaker sucks. p
good p
This is only my own humble review after a week's use after my Sony xperia z3 broke.PROSâ€”â€”â€”â€”Interface is interesting, it has many features, I like the icons and the way the lollipop runs on this phone, screen is big and the colors are good, it runs smooth overall for a 250 dollar phone, I consider it a good substitution for my non-waterproof Sony xperia z3, at a much lower cost, the games run with better performance on this one than in the z3.Sound software is good, and ear buds are much better than the ones that came on my z3, I find it enjoyable to listen to music on my idol 3.It is very light, I haven't dropped it once (which is rare for me) it's design I like more, the camera viewfinder is faster than on the Sony Xperia z3, even though photos are no as good but in relationship to cost/expectation it delivers so much more.CONSâ€”â€”â€”â€”Battery saving modes are nos as good as the xperia's staminas, the battery last a lot although not as I was used to on my older phone. Idol 3 has minor software related bugs (songs stutter every once in a while) volume control is rarely unresponsive and may lag from time to time, sometimes the volume responds but the meter on the screen is unresponsive. Phone may become laggy when more than 5 apps are open, so you have to close them. I haven't found any good cases available for the phone yet, the best one I bought was made out of poor material.Videos don't run as smooth as on my xperia z3.Overall: it is a lot for the price, I can find many pros on this phone over sonys flagship at the time of the review (z3) which costed me more than double the price for this one. It delivers more than expect for money on today's market. So considering that I have to give it a 5 star. p
Great phone for the money. No major complaints, I highly recommend it. p
Coming from a ZTE Z998, this phone is an enormous upgrade, but does have its quirks. There are many features of the phone that are simply great, but I'll cut the chase and get to the dirt:*Phone is a little laggy at time, especially in Google Chrome.*Double tap to Wake rarely works on time. Sometimes takes up from 1 to 3 minutes for the phone to finally come to the lock screen.*Cellular service signal often just quits. Not sure why, but it is kind of annoying.*LTE signal takes quite a while to lock in. Most of the time the signal comes in with H+. This does effect down/upload speeds.*I've found Bluetooth in my car to be a little quirky. Phone doesn't always sync automatically with my car's Bluetooth. Not sure why?*When getting a phone call with a 3.5 mm jack plugged in and Bluetooth also enabled, call goes through or comes in, but parties on the phone can't hear one another. I've looked into the settings, there may be an issue here?Aside from those issues above, which can likely be worked out if Alcatel ever issues an OTA update, the phone is great. Videos and music are crisp and clear. Games are fun to play, very little lag there. The screen is great! For a phone, the audio is fantastic! You can move your apps over to the SD card to save internal memory. Not all the app data is transferable, but being able to move it over does help. I wish there was a way to control where your "downloads" save file to, but unfortunately there is not and a download automatically saves to the phone's memory. You have to make a conscious effort to move the file over to the SD card, as to not consume your internal memory. 11 GB's of memory doesn't go too far these days.For the money at $250, this phone is a pretty good buy and worth the money. It is clear however where Alcatel cut some corners to stay in the $250 price range and still make profit. Too bad phones are so throw away after 2 years of use. Guess that's the nature of technology and people always wanting something better. Enjoy the phone!Screen protector and a phone case are a must if you want to preserve any phone for at least 2 years. There aren't too many phone case options for this phone yet thought. :-( p
Excellent value for your dollar and works on AT&T and T-Mobile networks at LTE speeds. Speakers are loud without distortion and screen is bright and clear with good viewing angles. p
I was very lucky I have this Android phone! Its cheap but, it has competetive performance compare to the high end android phone. I did not have a second thought to buy this gadget! p
I have T-Mobile and it works fantastically. I bought it because I needed a bigger screen (had the Moto G, another great phone) but the screen was too small. Great phone all around. p
Love this phone! I'm not a tech person, but I can absolutely appreciate the value I am getting from this $250 phone. If you don't care about all the speed ratings etc. , which for everyday typical phone use shouldn't make a difference, then I highly recommend checking out this phone. p
I bought this phone for my wife as a replacement for her old one. We both loved it ! It make me wish that I had ordered it for myself. It is a beautiful phone with great features at an incredible price. I am very pleased with this purchase. p
My 1st impression upon opening the box was "wow, this is gorgeous". Yes the back is plastic, but the build quality, color, finish and overall design makes it look and feel like a premium product. I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy yet lightweight it was when I first picked it up. Turning it on made me feel even more wowed. The screen is just gorgeous, probably the best that I've seen. It's sharp, hi-res, great colors, and the GUI and near stock Android experience makes the experience that much better (unlike Samsung or other phones where they have great screens but the GUI ruins the premium feel).There's some lag when I'm going from app to app, but I'd say it is something I can live with, it doesn't happen all the time and closing all the apps seems to remedy this problem. I'm able to play the latest games, and for the most part it's a fast experience.I was worried about the camera from all the reviews and 100% cropped sample images I saw on the web. But actually after several test shots I'm surprised that the photos turned out well. The photos are a little smudgy when zoomed 100%, and low light performance could be better, but when I'm viewing them on FB or just zoomed out on my pc, the photos are very clear, good contrast and decent colors. The quality reminds me of an entry to mid-level point and shoot camera, or an iPhone 4s or 5. I wouldn't zoom in all the way or print these photos that's for sure, but the camera is actually better than what all the reviews online have made it seem (it's a 250 dollar phone for crying out loud).Overall this phone is a steal at 250 bucks. I'm thinking of buying 1 for both my parents. I would not hesitate to buy this at all, and the best part, it's an affordable phone that doesn't look like an iPhone. p
It great ðŸ‘ p
I spent three weeks comparing phone specs on gsmarena and I'm very impressed by this phone. It stands up well against the so called "flagship" phones. For those looking at $100 phones, my advice would be to save your money and wait until you can buy the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 which is very reasonably priced for what it brings to the table. This phone is a very lightly skinned pure Android phone, which Alcatel did such a great job with I no longer need a launcher such as Nova. Over the air updates are also a major plus. The build quality is fantastic. This phone has a metal center body wrapped top and bottom with aluminum or stainless steel bands -- I can't tell which. The top band also wraps over the stereo speakers. The back is textured plastic, which is a must because it wont interfere with the internal antennas. I also like the slide out sim and SD card tray and the full 1080P display. Those things, and much more, are what you would normally pay $1K if you bought a "flagship" phone. One word of advice, leave the display brightness on "auto" or you'll use too much battery. Other than that, battery life is fantastic no matter how much you use this phone during the day. Alcatel would sell a lot more phones if they'd list more technical features for their phones, and I'm not really sure why they don't. I could write a lot more, but let's suffice to say, I am not easy to please but I am very happy with this phone. Normally I would find something I don't like, but in this case, that didn't happen. p
excellent p
I would not recommend this phone because it is NOT supported by the manufacturer. There is no support for this phone whatsoever. It's biggest problem is software and there isn't even a FAQ blog to go to. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!! n
Although the cameras are not the best in the world I cannot be too angry for $250!The screen is super bright and the speakers are front facing and better than my iPhone!Unfortunately the battery will not last you all day in heavy use but again for the price it cannot be beat! p
A lot of people have suggested that a power user should really go for one of the top tier flagship phones where they don't compromise on CPU, RAM, display etc. I am a software developer and most definitely a power user. I take a lot of time to customize my phone and I use it very heavily and I can say without a doubt, I will never spend $500 on a phone again now that I have seen what $250 can buy.If you know how to manage your memory, this phone is very snappy. I haven't done much in the way of 3D gaming so I can't comment on that but that's not a power user thing. That's a teenager nerd boy thing. If you want a mobile gaming platform for your spoiled brat, you may want to spend more. I for one couldn't imagine spending $600 or more on a phone that will probably get broken in your kids backpack, but that's your call.The display is quite nice, clear, bright colors. The camera is even quite good. The battery could be better but it still lasts me a full day with heavy use. I'm not a big fan of the stock user interface but now that I've loaded Apex Launcher, that's been resolved anyways. There are a ton of launcher options out there and they all offer a better than stock user experience in my opinion. I highly recommend Nova, Apex or Hola Launcher but there are a bunch out there worth exploring. I'm happy with Apex but I like to explore and see what else is possible.Still, if all of that was good but the call quality was bad, this wouldn't not be a positive rating. That was a major concern for me since there are some ratings out there that knock the call quality. I really don't understand professional reviewers on sites like C-Net or PC Mag that give a glowing review of the phone when the one negative is the poor call quality. It's a smartPHONE. The PHONE part should be the most important. Anyways, while it's not the best call quality I've had, it's actually quite good. The only complaint I have about call quality is that I sound a little tin to the user on the other end of the call. They can still hear me clearly, even in a noisy environment and there's no reverb or echo or scratchiness. The sound quality on my end is quite good also, including the speakerphone. Also, I get a better (cell radio) signal with this phone than I did with my T-Mobile HTC One or my unlocked Sony Z3 which means I can make calls in places where I couldn't with those phones and I have less likelihood of having a call dropped.For this price point, it's a fantastic phone. I used to only buy flagship phones for between $500 and $700 and I always felt ripped off (Sony, Samsung, HTC). This is the first phone purchase I've made in the last 7 years that I feel like I got my money's worth (and then some).Bottom line, if you are in the market for a flagship phone, consider what you will actually be using it for. Then consider saving yourself some money. p
I offers more than any other phone alone or together. Speed, look, one can answer in any side. Has an excellent look. Light and thin. A 5.5 display, wide front camera - has a great back camera. On top the Audio Mix - has an excellent crystal sound on 5.1 stereo and great great headphones.On top, it offers more than iPhone 6 on $250. After a day paying with it - a friend of mine - just garbed it from me. Now I have to boy another one :). Currently I have an Idol 2 - but Idol 3 is much more advanced. I recommend it to all. p
Is good. p
The phone is alright but the new update have it kind of buggy and I don't like how they put the charger at the bottom. Also the front facing speakers or up to par when watching videos. p
great p
I surprised my girlfriend with this phone for Christmas and she loves it. The wasome thing about is,there is very little that this phone won't do. Definitely worth the price and then some. The resolution isn't half bad at all and the interface is very clean and bear stock Android. p
The processor is SUPER SLOW .. the battery life SUCKS .. on a full charge overnight not even 2 hours and it's already near 70% lags a lot and it just annoys me a lot because of how slow and unresponsive it can get. I wouldn't recommend anyone getting this phone if they don't like waiting for their phone to just open a simple messenger app. n
Very unhappy with this phone... I cannot send or receive pictures on message.. Also I cannot delete emails.. It says I'm not connected yet I'm on line... I've talked to my carriers and they say all my settings are correct... I cannot continue to deal with this, I'm pulling my hair out.. I'll be returning this phone as soon as I get another one and get my information off this one. n
So far this phone is awesome. I am using it on Metro PCS. In the metro Detroit area I can generally hit around 70 Mbps all the time. Phone is running fast and not lagging even when using multiple apps. Speakers are super loud. So far I love this phone. Update. After a month of having this phone I have to say I love it. It is everything I want in a smart phone. Great screen. Super bright. Very thin. Awesome battery life. Good speed opening and switching between apps. Love the loud decent sounding front facing stereo speakers. Love being able to use phone in any orientation. Why buy a phone for 200 on contract when I can buy this and not be locked down to a carrier. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a perfect midrange phone. p
Good phone for the price excellent display and speakers but the processor is little slow n
Bought 4 wife. She hates it. Non-intuitive. Wifi drops regularly, although the phone reports that it's connected. I've tried troubleshooting it. I hate it too.Troubleshooting answer. Problem was that this phone saves the last IP address of each WiFi. This is sub optimal, because the router isn't using fixed addresses. Win7, Win8, Linux, other Android, and Fire platforms all handled this with no problem.The manual and support site are not useful. We've still got a beef that the phone is often taking screen shots for no apparent reason.I might raise my rating to 1.5, but I'm still in trouble with my wife for buying it for her. n
Good phone overall. Excellent speakers and very user friendly. I've had this phone for about 6 months now. The only problems I see that are major issues are the reception and text message issues. Reception on this phone is extremely spotty. I have my galaxy S5 next to it - sometimes the idol will be on emergency calls only while the S5 has one bar of 4G LTE. The text messages will come in out of order sometimes. Also, group texts revert to a 1970 date and fall to the very bottom of the text queue. Also, the lag on this phone is noticeable with textsBecause of these major issues, I would likely not buy again. n
The positive 5-star reviews are accurate, and overall this is a great quality phone for the price. Everything works well.However, after having used it for some months, then trying out an HTC m7 with a 4.7 inch screen, I wish I had gone with the 4.8inch version of the Alcatel oneTouch Idol. While readability and viewing videos from a distance is nice, the 5.5" screen is too clumsy, too difficult to hold in one hand, and too long to fit in a pocket. It just scares me. I live in fear that it will grow too big for me to safely control anymore, and one day it will take over my life.It is also incredibly slippery without a case. More points off for handle-ability. I think they grease the backside with Crisco. This, combined with the clumsy size, makes it super easy to slip out of your hand.Even with the case (I bought here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZOER95Q?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage) it is difficult to keep in one place. It's a slippery fish just waiting to flop around and escape your grasp to fulfill its secret plans of world domination. p
Good enough phone at a price that can't be beat. n
Phone stopped working and won't turn on in less than one year, vendor (Good guys) say their warranty is only 90 days, now trying to deal directly with Alcatel. This is what you get for not buying reputable brands like Samsung, Apple, etc... Will never buy Alcatel again. n
It's been about a year since I've had this phone and I would buy it again if the new version wasn't out. For those interested in this phone it is under $100 here on Amazon. I find that a great price for a beginner smart phone or for a person who isn't interested in all the bells and whistles of a $700 phone. This thing gets the job done for me running on Android 6.0.1. Ok now for the reason why I gave it 4/5 stars. The phone battery gets warm to the touch under heavy use like watching videos which causes it to kind of feel sluggish. The camera is weak under low light conditions but that didn't bother me since I rarely used the camera. Video quality is alright in clear conditions but like the camera I had no use for that feature. Finally battery life is not that great if you find yourself away from an outlet. Good thing it charges fast. I could go into other features but it really is just a phone for me to keep in touch with family and work. One final thing. The up front dual speakers make listening to music fun. No more cupping the speaker to redirect the sound! p
This phone seemed ok at first.Out of nowhere the power button started shorting out, if pressed the phone would turn back on like it was stuck...electrical problem not physical though.Few weeks later SD slot failed.I've been on hold with Alcatel trying to do a return for the last 45 minutes, this company and their products seems pretty bad.-Followup, phone volume button automatically starts increasing volume, shorting similar to the power button. This turns the display on and causes the battery to drain quickly.When the battery fully drains the phone doesn't turn on even at full charge, it has to be overcharged for another hour before it turns on. Had to charge mine 10 hours last time battery complete drained before it would turn back on.The person who said this review is not helpful was probably a shill working for this crap company. n
Awesome!! I haven't had any problems with it. Nice screen and speakers. The camera is great for the price, good colors and all of that. Only one thing it does get a little warm but cools fast p
Crashes and reboots frequently. In Whatsapp, it hangs when viewing an image... slow. Screen already has a break without dropping it, and it has a rubber protector. Worst, a hairline break on the screen has made the keyboard useless, can't return phone... it's dead in only 35 days...I made a mistake buying it... n
So far so good. Great screen and not too slow p
I am very disappointed with this purchase. I have been using the phone for less than 2 weeks and I am very close to flushing it down the toilet! Within a few days of using it, i noticed it started freezing for hours on end and only a battery pull can resolve that temporarily.... Please note that I have only ever downloaded one app and that's whatsapp. About the 5th day of using the phone, I noticed that it began shutting down on its own, sometimes it restarts, most times it doesn't. Another issue is that the wifi keeps turning off on its own or just jumping off the internet. Also, the mobile data also spontaneously turns off by itself. Yes, that's 4 issues in just about 12 days of owning this phone. It has now become the bane of my existence! I am so frustrated with this phone, they don't even deserve 1/16th of a star! I will never purchase this phone ever again and I wouldn't want it even if I was being gifted one! I will also warn everyone I know not to purchase this phone, for the statisfaction they will receive from the reasonable price will surely be negated shortly thereafter with the range of issues that this phone has. I guess I will just have to dig deeper and purchase a more reliable phone that will undoubtedly cost me 4 times than what I paid for this, I felt like I wasted my $200. I am certain of one thing, an Alcatel phone will never be brought into my home again! People be warned.... Don't waste your energy, money or time, just save until you can get a better phone, one with warranty and some accountability on the company's part and most importantly never purchase a phone over Amazon. I am totally dissatisfied with the entire purchase as I also never received the Mr. shield screen protector and when I contacted them they told me to contact Amazon! I should have known this was a raw deal and returned everything! Alas, this will never ever happen again. Worst purchase ever! n
After about 7 years of iphones (3/4/5), this was my first Android, and I was initially thrilled because it was cheap and large and seemed to work well.That ended after about two months, when it started lagging and/or crashing constantly. I was resetting 2-3 or more times every day, and it became near useless. I reinstalled and wiped multiple times and nothing improved it. The camera is also very very poor compared to an iphone and even some other Androids. Fortunately it got stolen from me after about 4 months, so I had an excuse to buy a new phone. n
Reboots by itself 4 Times/ Hangs up calls 4 times n
Excellent product!!!!!! i recomend it 100% p
I'm using this phone 3 weeks now and so far have no complains. I'm not a power user which menas mostly web browsing, Viber, messaging, phone calls etc. My sone downloaded some quite demanding games on it and all were running with no issues. The device is always on WiFi or LTE and I can get a 1.5 days from it easily (4.5 hours SOT).There are some intermittent lags I notice but not really significant. Most of the times the phone is very responsive.I like very much how it looks and it's screen size and quality.My previous phone was Nokia Lumia 830 which had very good rear camera but do not feel this phone is a step back.Overall for 160$ on Amazon this was a very good deal. Hopefully it'll carry at least an year and more. p
Needed a new phone since I broke the screen on my new galaxy 5 in the first 2 months I owned it. I read the reviews and ordered the Idol 3 since it was cheaper than replacing the screen and digitized on the Samsung. I just hoped for the best, and can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised. The phone looks, feels and operates like a quality product. I like it and its features better than the Samsung. I have had it about a week and could not be more satisfied. We'll see how it goes, but as of now I highly recommend this phone. p
It didn't work. Had a mind of its own. I need to send it back! This was my 2nd one.It did the same thing. I've sworn off Alcatel for good. n
Nice phone for what I paid (99). I'd much rather pay this price whenever my phone breaks then paying 600-800 for another phone!Overall good buy. Works well, has nice features. p
Guys excellent phone than moto g play all with jbl speakers and headphones just buy first and than see the magic good budgeted phone just for 99 dollars p
I bought this phone for 99dollars .for 99 dollars its a decent phone . If it costs more than 99 dollars I would send it back . I picked it up for a back up phone. I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer . p
I have never owned a smartphone because I am always near a computer or a family member with a smartphone. On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve. p
This phone is very slow. Want to navigate somewhere? Well, it might take 3 minutes to load your directions. It also sends and receives group messages from 1970. Very inconvenient because they come in at the bottom your message inbox. It also broke after 6 months. I would not buy this item again! In fact, I despite the money lost I am relived that it broke. n
I just love it and it was a big deal!!! :D p
this was a great deal at $99. Most reviews don't mention the fact that it as facial recognition and iris scanner as an option to unlock it too. That's something iPhone 7 doesn't even have. I use mine with a magnetic holder in my car with no case necessary since the magnet sticks to where the battery is. Not many other phones do that. The reversible feature is cool too. All the reviews on youtube say it's a great deal at $249. There is no other 5.5", HD, microSD expandable android phone out there nearly this good at anywhere near this price. p
Great phone. I Upgraded from the Moto G LTE which was $220. The difference is night and day in terms if performance. Everything opens super quick and it almost never lags. The camera is great so far (especially the manual mode). Cheap phones are getting better and better each year. Battery life is great as well. p
I try and test new phones all the time. This phone easily won me. Beautiful hardware with very light tweaks to Android where they actually make sense. Alcatel is an underdog now and underdogs work hard and put great offers. This is a clearly one.Specifications wise, I won't recommend this for a serious gamer as there is a noticeable lag after opening many apps. The battery is good. The drive space is small but expandable. The camera and speakers are also premium and surprising. p
I felt like I should write a review on this as a "average" phone user.I am a tech guy and have worked in IT for over 15 years, but I don't have to have the best of the new phones. I use mine for mail constantly, browsing 10 or so times a day, usually just to look something up quickly at home. Facebook at night a few times maybe, every once in a while games, but usually just basic stuff like Spades or backgammon, every once in awhile some "better" game. Maybe 50 texts a month on average.On to the phone, keep in mind I am coming from a Razr MI ordered 2 of these to replace to Razr M's on Verizon and we were switching over to Cricket wireless so perfect time for this phone to release.Setup - super easy, Turned on the phone, picked my language, setup my wireless connection, and it let me know there was a 50+mb update. Took like 3 seconds to download it and then it installed and rebooted,It then prompted me to setup or transfer my account, I figured hey transfer it, it told me to put my old phone back to back and seconds later my account had transferred over.The screen is huge compared to what I am used to, and very bright, I have it on auto-adjust but it's usually around 20% brightness, it is so bright.I don't use my phone while walking to text or do Facebook etc. but I have checked notifications outside, no problems reading in sunlight. Colors look fine to me, at least for what I need.Audio is pretty loud, the dual stereo speakers are more than what I would expect out of my phone.If I want to share a YouTube video with someone we both have no problems hearing it play.Web browsing, I have had no real problems or lag as some others seem to have had, but I do limit what I browse to on my phone, I don't go to some of the sites that have tons of ads etc. on my phone. I have no problems with slickdeals or dealnews like some people have mentioned.Wi-Fi speed is awesome on mine, I am on 5G in my house and it's so much faster than my old phone or my laptops. It's actually just as fast as my main rig on a wired connection. Every test I have run is over 55mb down and 6mb up and I am on a 50/5 plan. For me it's very fast as tested by Ookla on multiple servers.Data speed, I don't use much as I am on wireless at home and at work, but I have had 4gLTE everywhere I have checked it and I am in Northern Idaho which doesn't have near the same coverage as say Seattle.I haven't had any problems with any apps installing or crashing.Actually I have several apps that seem to work a lot better.Fitbit, and Yamaha AV Controller for example work so much better and quickerBluetooth is great, synced to my car easier than my last 2 phones did, has extra security on "trusted" devices for both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices.Supports USB and Wi-Fi tethering, both of which I will probably never use.I have a 64gb SD card in mine and the limited access I have used it for has been fine.Reversible mode works and is neat to show people, but I like most people will usually pick up my phone the right way, but it makes handing your phone to someone else easier if you want to show them something.Tap to wake - this is discussed a lot, works fine every time for sleep, but it does seem like some app installs make it wonky. If I go back into gestures and turn it off and then turn it back on it seems to fix the problem.Not all apps break it, but I have had it happen twice now.I don't have a problem with the power button on the left, fine by me, better than on the top like some phones.Included apps don't bother me at all, and lollipop seems to run fine on my phone.Some people have had problems etc. but anyone who has been around tech knows, all companies, all products, ship bad batches.Phone is very light but I am getting used to it already, I have it in a case which has made it not seem so fragile anymore.Overall I really like the phone and for $200 pre-ordered I am more than happy. Plus I used turbo-tax this year so bonus Amazon gift-cards paid for mine.As for the camera, I haven't used it yet, I take pictures on family outings etc. but haven't had the chance yet.Plus if I know I am going somewhere I will want to take pictures ahead of time I am going to take my DSLR.I honestly don't care what the camera is like on my phone to be honest, but the little I have seen will be fine for my needs.I paid more for each of my lenses on my DSLR then I did for this phone, so what do I expect right?There are some other things I could talk about, but that is the gist of what I am going to use the phone for.Update:7:00 a.m. 5/28 took it off the charger - 10:18 p.m. 5/29 44% left on the battery after 2 days of use, several phone calls and 6 trips in the car synced to the car.Also should note you can go into the specifics of the battery and view Wi-Fi and network strength as well as screen-on time for the entire time broken down by the hour since last charged.At this rate I could make it almost 2 more days before running out of battery.Also should note I have the notification LED off and the notification tone set to only go off once when something comes in.Update 6/3 I took my wife's off the charger 5/28 and she has used it mildly since then. She has been home a few of the days, but still uses it everyday a little. As of 9:00 last night phone was at 50%. Pretty dang good. Keep in mind my old Razr M had to be charged halfway through the day at this point due to shortened battery life. So being able to go for days is so nice. I went 4 days on my last charge as well. But I didn't make it to 6 like the wife did.Still enjoying the phone, I still cannot believe how much better all my apps work on the new phone compared to on KitKat.Update 7/13 For those that were asking 52 days, just got upgraded to 5.0.2 today on the firmware. So they are updating pretty well since it's product launch time hasn't even been 2 months and they already have 2 updates plus dealing with all the BS from a product launch so overall I would say pretty good.Still love the phone, I would say the battery life is a little shorter than I first thought but I think it's because it works so well I find myself using it a lot more than I used to use my old phone.Still a great value for the money for me. p
Overall this phone is a good value for money. I personally believe most of the current very "few" issues are due to buggy lollipop not the hardware of this phone. Battery life and Screen can beat the crap out of any phone on market. I dont think its a sluggish phone by any sense. A little hiccup here and there is okay for a normal user. I tried playing few games as well , could not find any lag. For $200 its equal to any phone which is right now for $400 p
If you are in the market for a smartphone (even if your not) and you're thinking $600-700 for the one that has the features you want, look no further. If you don't take advantage of the Alcatel one touch idol 3 for $249.00 including free shipping, you will be missing out on the best deal going right now. Why buy a V12, when a V8 will do the job just fine and looking very stylish too. I've had mine a few days and it does everthing it says in all the videos and reviews and very well I think. Save some money! Isn't that what it's all about. p
Out of the box, the phone already had problems. During setup the phone developed a serious error that could only be resolved by doing a factory reset. I used the phone for 4 days after doing the factory reset, pretty happy with its performance. But then this morning I went to turn it on for the first time - black screen. Tried holding down the power button for several seconds, nothing. Tried doing a factory reset, nothing. Since the battery is not removable, there's nothing to be done now except send it back. It's really too bad that I waited 5 weeks for this phone to come out and in the first week it already turned out to be a piece of junk. Super disappointed. n
A very solid phone for the asking price.I was able to purchase this device during promotion for 199 dollar, but in this review i will compare to the Mate 2, Note 4 and Nexus 4, iphone5, which at the time of my purchase was 300 dollar, 750 dollar, 360 dollar and 600 dollar. I'd like to mention that the asus zenfone 2 is a very capable phone and priced at 199/299, but i do not have a unit to compare with.pro1. build quality is superb. the phone is assembled with high precision, the unit is very thin and very solid. the entire phone has no creaking when pressed and each button has very nice tactile feel. it is very similar to the feeling of Nexus 4, which was also superb in term of build quality and overall finishing.2. the speaker is superb. it is up there with HTC boomsound and i think it might actually better at bass (HTC may be better at treble). at any rate. the speaker is miles apart from anything else and even better than most tables (that includes ipad). the true stereo speaker and high definition sound (for a phone) really helps when you watch video or play game without headphones or boombox. and most importantly, this phone's speaker are very well placed and it hides within the frames. so all the glory without HTC's huge ugly speaker grills.3. screen is awesome. it has one of the brightest screen on a phone. no issue to use in the day light and it is capable of display vivid images at a extreme wide angle. it easily rivals the screen found on iphone 5. in the realm of IPS, this screen is as good as it goes. (but i still prefer the ALMOED on Note 4 better for its deep contrast).4. stock andriod. pretty much the vanilla andriod with very little touch to add alcatel's reversible screen. which means very little overhead and smooth operation.5. support SD card. while most say SD card is useless, i would not purchase a device without capability of expanding storage. i often travel for business and leisure. and many place i go does not have cellphone reception or in an country that cell data is very slow. I always keep the Here map and its offline data in my phone in case i need direction, and that's a good 15 to 20G of data all by itself. and if one uses the phone to take photo or video, he/she will use few gig of storage in a week or two. bottom line, after 9 month of using Note 4, i have already exhausted the 64G SD card and just moved to 200G SD card. and having SD card on a phone, even if you don't think you need it, is a big plus to me.average1. camera is very average for 2015 flagship phone (but very good for 2013 standard). the only other phone i have at the time of the photo comparison is Note 4, which was released in 2014 but has one of the very best camera in smart phone at the time of this review. compared with Note 4, the onetouch idol lacks resolution, white balancing and image sharpness in pretty much any lighting condition. However, i would say that Idol3 does perform very well compared to the flagship phone from two generations ago (e.g. iphone5, Galaxy S4). do bear in mind that this phone does not have a sticking out camera housing like the latest smart phones, and this phone is VERY thin (7.4 mm compared with iphone 5's 7.6 mm). it's optics will suffer even with a capable CMOS sensor.2. performance. again, this phone would have no problem when compared with flagship phones from two generations ago (like HTC M7, S4 or iPhone 5) and might even be slightly faster. which is to say that phone is perfectly capable for daily tasks such as reading email, browsing web or play games (even the very intensive games like implosion). you would probably see occasion lag when scrolling through a huge PDF file or some complicated websites, or a longer loading time for games, but not a deal breaker in my mind. it is not until you doing transcoding or running benchmarks will you see the huge difference between current gen flagship and this phone, but who dose transcoding in the phone anyways?3. reception. in the same location, this phone's reported reception is always about 11 to 15 dbm lower than the Note 4. which would technically translate to 20% of signal strength (since the highest is probably -60 dbm if you standing right next to the tower and lowest usable cell phone strength is around -125).4. compromises: with such wonderful design and display, there are sacrifices has to be made for this release price. for one thing: you don't have 802.11 ac, you don't have Magnetometer or a Gyroscope, all of which zenfone 2 has for similar and cheaper MSRP (199). while i do miss the magnetometer and gyroscope for fast location and direction. i do not miss the 802.11 ac feature. the ac allows you to transfer files at a much greater speed (about twice as fast compared to n in my test with computers), but this is completely useless because the phone's internal storage is so slow that it doesn't matter how fast you can pull down the data. at least on my Note 4, the transfer rate doesn't seem to have any difference when running ac or n.4. processor: i am not against weak processors and i have said this processor does do it job. BUT the 615 is just gimmicky. technically with its octa core, it should be little-big design that you have two cluster of computing units, one is fast but power hungry (A57/A15) while another (A53/A7) is slow but power efficient. but in this device, you have 8 A53 core, just one cluster is clocked faster. REALLY??? qualcomm has no reason to not just release it with standard 4core A53s and add a speed governor to achieve the same effect. in fact, qualcomm said themselves that 615 was released due to market demand for more cores not due to power efficiency or performance. i'd much rather see a 801 or intel's core in this phone than 615 for the similar price.overall, a very solid phone that actually have a good design. it is one of those product that doesn't do all the justice just by reading the spec sheet. you have to see it in person and feel it in hand to appreciate its craftsmanship and balanced performance. while not perfect, it does have a lot of merit for its price tag even at 250 USD. This p
I decided to put down my big name flagship for a bit, and was pleasantly surprised.This device boasts a bright (even on low) large screen, decent processor, Android Lollipop, front facing speakers, good battery life, and LTE band 12 that I need on T-Mobile. And that whole package comes in at an insanely low price.It's not as fast as my Oneplus One's 801 processor, but overall I'll take front facing speakers and better LTE over minimal processor speed gains. It is an octacore 64 bit, so it's no snail, it can compete with any big name device. IMHO the speed races are over, and software/hardware optimization is key, which Alcatel did a great job.Oh and this brings JBL headphones, it's rare that any OEM puts accessories with devices now, some don't even include chargers.Software wise, it's very much Vanilla like. The screen rotates no matter which way you turn it, it adjusts to you. Also, you can double tap to wake AND to sleep. It's the simple things that I love. And since it's running on Snapdragon, you won't have compatibility issues (Intel) or slow downs (Mediatek).Ultimately I was too used to my Oneplus customizations so the OPO called back to me. But if I didn't have my old flagship killer, this would be my phone. I'm recommending this device to everyone!*UPDATE*I had the device in a case, and screen protector. It suffered its first drop, from hands, and the screen shattered. Be VERY CAREFUL.Also, I plan on getting a tempered glass protector once I get it back.In case I run into any issues on RMA I'm paying for, I'll update.*UPDATE 2Really expensive repair service. $39.99 triage fee charged whether you get it repaired or not, if you don't pay it you don't get your phone back.+$54 for a screen replacementI'm done with Alcatel n
I caught this during their pre-release. At the time I was thinking about replacing my cracked screen Note 2. My phone was still functional, but it has been a couple years. Since the Note 5 should be released soon, I purchased this inexpensive phone in the interim. I wasn't expecting so much, other than it to hold me over.Pulling it out of the packaging, immediately, it felt slim and light. Almost light to the point of cheapness. That feeling has gone away since, now I appreciate how slick and light weight it is.I fired it up, the screen looks beautiful. Bright, with great color too. Turned it back off, inserted my sim card and sd card. That was a bit cumbersome compared to previous phones that I have had, but given the slim nature of the design, it may have been a necessity. After getting it all setup, and navigating around a bit, I found it pretty snappy. I downloaded my normal apps, and installed Aviate, the launcher which I have been using since beta and find very clean.If you're coming from 4.x Android or another OS, you won't have the small gripes that I have. I had installed Cyanogenmod 12.1 on my note 2 before switching to this phone and there are quite a few features I miss from that version. These are minor, and in no way have a significant negative affect on how I like this phone. The fact you can use the phone, or any app upside down is a neat idea, but in practice, your buttons are in the wrong spot, and it still feels upside down. The camera seems good, but I am no camera expert, and only take pictures from time to time.Over the past week or so, here is what I found that stands out:Good:Front facing speakersScreen quality, bright and detailedLight weight*** PRICE *** I doubt you'll find anything close in this price range, rivals $500+ phones imoBattery lifeCall quality via hand set, speaker phone and bluetoothNot so good:Not a lot of case optionsOther notes that may affect your purchase decision:Charging port position is off center, awkward, and may interfere with some cradlesPower button feels like it is in the wrong spotNon-removable battery, may be no issue, I haven't ever replaced a battery in my other phones, and I expect one to last at least a couple years which is fine to me.Bottom line for me:I was surprised how good this phone is. Initially it was supposed to be temporary, but I will keep it until I break it. Good phone, crazy awesome price! Unless you want the specific name brand, buy this, you won't be sorry.6/3/15Updated observations:When in a phone call, the screen doesn't rotate, even when just using bluetooth. This causes a small issue when I want to go from a phone call to using navigation software since I want the landscape view. As soon as the call hangs up, it rotates how it should.I had one random reset, of course this was while I was navigating downtown Seattle and needed to know my next turn.I took the time to watch video on this, and the audio is AWESOME!Battery life is definitely acceptable for me, not the best or worst. It lasts me more than all day though with moderate use.There is a feature that can be turned on that allows you to tap twice to turn on/off the screen, that does not work so well.7/7/15Ended up with a very small scratch on the screen, probably from my keys, so if you pick this up, get a screen protector.Still overall a five star purchase to me! p
Stay away from Alcatel products. They do not do updates but when they do it us not for your benefit. The only real update was forced onto the idol 3 phone and it removed band 12 from the phone. This is a BIG deal if you use TMobile. Alcatel advertised it band 12 capable, it is now not. n
works great had to do factory reset as soon as i got it p
Garbage! Stay away. Work for like 5 months. Lcd stop working. I had to pay 10 dollars and one week without phone to send to alcatel.Two months later power button stop working. Physically its fine but i guess electrical;y no. Just terrible quality control or just super cheap parts.Do not waste your money. Ive read at least another 100 reviews same issues in less than 1 year for a phone in meticulus condition in a bomb proof case the entire time. Thank god i have a moto g 3 as a backup i bought used the first time this garbage broke. Lesson learned. Stick with the big names htc samsung lg apple moto/lenovo...260 dollars down the drain. smh ..don't how this company is still around..... n
This phone ' is awsome. BRIGHT, FAST, AND LIGHT!! AWSOME!!! p
This is great for a budget phone. Gorgeous display. If you are on the fence about this phone, just go ahead and get it. Can't go wrong for 250 bucks. p
Awesome phone just as I expected per reviews I have read. Battery is great, and no bloat ware. p
Total upgrade to my Moto G 2014.Great phone, great price, unbelievable deal! p
Love it and you can't beat the price. Anyone who pays 2-3 times this price for a smart phone is missing out. p
Sim tray is a problem to use with a nano SIM card adapter . n
Simply the BEST budget smartphone out there now even better then the Motorola Moto G! This phone is packed with features like tap to wake, Android 5.0.2 a reversible hand set the can be used even upside down and has 4G LTE for all Gsm carries such as T-Mobile and AT&T.. So what are you waiting for a must buy smartphone for 2015! p
Not a bad phone, but not a great one.Out of the box it's pretty quick, but after installing a few apps a and a little use it slows way down.The pictures and video are good, but the poor placement of the camera lens takes some getting used to, I had a lot of shots with the edge of my finger in them.It's very light and thin which is good and bad.Good because, well, it's light and thin.Bad because, being made of plastic and that light, it feels very cheap.I like the fact that it's a mostly stock interface with some customization.If you're thinking of this phone I would (and did) spend $50 more dollars and get the Asus Zenfone 2.. it's lightyears ahead of this phone (in terms of performance) and only a little bit more.The photos and video on the Idol 3 are very slightly better, but everything else on the Zenfone 2 is better. n
if u have no ther option, then u better stay with no phone. Days 1 thru 3 were good. Then everything went downhill. The phone lags, it stutters, it freezes to the point where it begins to get hot and it locks up. The phone did feel ok in the hand. oh yeah and the speakers were good. n
Can't beat this phone for the price! I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 and haven't looked back.My only complaint is the lack of removable battery, but luckily that hasn't been an issue yet. p
Great deal for price. Thin, great battery life, sharp and bright screen. This not a low end phone as price would suggest. You can get half a dozen of these for the price of an Iphone. My wife has had one for a year with no issues so I replaced my Fire phone with one to get the larger screen. Fire phone still has the best interface. Wish Amazon had keep up development on it p
This is the second one I purchased, one for each parent. Since the price had dropped significantly it was a steal. At under $200 this phone is a solid buy. So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos. p
First things first, this phone is HUGE! I love it! I am so glad this isn't a flagship phone either for two reasons.1. The price! This phone is exactly the same software and hardware as $400+ phones the memory/RAM may just be better!2. Because it isnt a flagship there isnt any "forced" signing into your personal email, google or other accounts. Pop a sim card in and you're good to go!Now to the phone itself, the video display is amazing so crisp and clear. I tend to have my phone in the lowest brightness setting all the time to preserve battery life and the video is still amazing.The pictures and videos the phone take are to cool, I love the time lapse that saves as a video file. My wife has the same phone and loves using Snapchat with it, even though there is no front flash.I like playing games on mine and the size of this thing makes it so easy, because the ram is so good there is no lag/freezing. It's now almost 2017 and I can download and play all the modern day apps and games extremely well. including pokemon GO. This camera will work with pokemon GO as well. p
Great value for an unlocked phone. Sound and screen both are great. Using on AT&T network in Texas. p
Bien p
The bottom half of the screen stopped working and will not respond to touch. I guess you get what you pay for?? n
Incredible phone for the price, very pleased with purchase p
Beautiful well performing android. Processor is quick, takes decent pictures, and display is very nice. However, the home button stopped working after 11 months of use. Now, cannot let the phone go into sleep mode or let the battery die because it won't come back on. n
Everything I had hoped for.Fantastic phone for the money.The music quality is excellant. p
Its has been a decent phone since I bought it. There are some quirks with the messaging app, like it will show a message in bold that has been read if the person is also in a multi-person message and responds; even when both messages have been read. The camera is not that great for photos or videos inside. Reception on T-Mo and ATT have been fine. WIFI and BT have worked without problems also. Definitely worth the pre-order price. p
Excellent phone for a good price. Already has received an update for Stagefright while lots of high end flagship phones haven't. p
It is big, which works well with my big hands. It's cheap, it's responsive and had a great looking screen. It can finally be rooted, so I'm keeping an eye out on development for this phone. I've dropped it plenty of times and the screen hasn't cracked. Maybe that has to do with the LK TPU case I have on it. The software and timely updates have made the phone better. Good camera and speakers. It has band 12 for Tmobile LTE. Unlocked for any carrier.My issues with it are the button placement for power and volume. The power button should have been placed halfway down the phone instead of right across from the volume buttons. I often trigger a screenshot when i just wanted to turn the screen off. As time goes on I am getting used to the placement and I make those errors less often. Also, the double tap to sleep/wake up is not always responsive. I try a few times, and then I end up having to push the power button to wake up the phone (which is what I would have done anyway if there was no tap to sleep feature). Overall very happy with this phone. p
This phone is really nice for the money. The front facing speakers and the dragontail screen are what originally sold me on the phone, as these features are really hard to find on phones with higher price tags. The screen is so smooth and very responsive. The weight and balance is just right, so you feel like you got something for your money. Yes, there is some bloatware but, there are some good apps to remove what you don't want. The JBL headphones that come with this phone are a nice added bonus. Packaging is very nice also. Alcatel really hit the mark with this one. Let's just hope they keep up. The only bad which may not be bad for everyone, is the reversal of the on/off and volume buttons. I would fire the engineer that threw that in the suggestion box. Overall I really like this phone and wouldn't trade mine for an iphone or samsung... p
The best mid range smart phone on the market. Bought this for my mother-in-law and its been an amazing performer. Great display..camera..size..she absolutely loves it.Update: 11-20-2016Just purchased another of these phones in September to replace the original one because the screen was broken. One morning a week ago my mother- in- law woke up and the phone no longer works. It's about a month past the return date and the phone is now being sold for almost twice what we paid for it. If a new battery doesn't fix this dead phone issue we r sick with a new phone that doesn't work. n
Great phone for a great price. I love the hardware. The Alcatel UI could use some work. Very crude and not sleek. p
Great phone. Easy to navigate. Good battery life. I love it. p
After a week with the phone it just exploded in my pocket I returned it any bought the way better one plus one. n
I switched to the Idol 3 from a Galaxy Note 2, haven't looked back ever since. For the price, you can't beat this phone. The screen is bright and clear. The dual speakers are loud and make watching videos or listening to music really enjoyable. I love the placement of the speakers on the front. The camera is ok. Pictures are great during the day time with abundant light. However night and low light pictures are a bit grainy. Having said that, there are phones that cost more with worse cameras. Is this better than an iPhone 6 or Galaxy S6? No, but are those phones worth 3X the price? Heck no.Bottom line: This phone cannot be beat for the price. p
A very cool design, awsome layout, and good quality for a really fair price. The only problem with the phone that I've had is with putting in the SD card and SIMs card in and phone will reboot itself sometimes but all is good for how much it is p
Pleasing device. Smooth transition from Galaxy Note 3. Too easily snap screen shots due to my clumsy grip. Great reception. Sharp screen. Recommend second to Galaxy family of phones. p
I'll never buy a ridiculously expensive phone again! Hopefully they keep producing this quality at a reasonable price. I'm just an average daily user and I've found no fault at all with this device. p
Absolutely love this phone. Using on T-Mobile and binge on. Great screen and love the FORWARD facing speakers. Highly recommend! p
I have had other phones (Moto G 1st and 2nd generation, Moto E) but the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 is by far the best one that I have used. I enjoy using this phone, compared to the others that I have owned. I would recommend this phone to anyone. p
I ordered this cellphone as a gift for a family member that was in need for a much needed cellphone.The family that received this cellphone was overjoyed when they unwrapped the box. It was a birthday gift to a family member. The phone is a great size phone that was bigger than what I expected , this phone has great features and was easy for me to set up for that family member, and I had no problem with this phone ,this phone will last for a long time for this family member. Overall this is a great phone. Disclaimer : I purchased this on my own personal behalf, and opinions are 100% of my own. p
100 % Recomendable p
Don't buy if you use T-Mobile or there 4g towersAlcatel removed band 12 without warning. And they won't help me contacted several times . n
The only drawback is that the Alcatel phone that claims to have 16 GB of internal storage, when I check the drive settings - storage, I find myself having only 10.95 GB of internal storage , in other words it was not 100% described the product sales , I get discouraged a little. n
I have 2 void stickers on my so called new phone. Does that mean I'm not covered by warranty the box looks open n
Bought this phone when it first came out and was surprised on how high quality it actually is. The phone is not the fastest, but that didn't disappointed me considering the low price. Besides the great screen, the two front facing speakers are loud and clear. A lot better than some high end phones. The camera is pretty good, but then again, that's not the reason I bought it because I don't take many pics. I bought it for the front facing speakers since I do watch a lot of movies and videos.I have read negative reviews regarding support, but that's not the case with me. I did sent my phone in for repair and had it back all within 1 week. To me, support was excellent and fast.I definitely recommend this phone if you're on a budget and are looking for a great phone with an excellent media experience. p
Just make sure to get a case and tempered glass screen protector, because many reviews state the glass is low quality, and the phone is slippery.Here are some things I'd like to see in an Idol 4.Better camera qualityBetter build quality (Includes screen)Less lagAndroid MarshmallowIf those issues were improved/fixed, this phone would surely be one of the best on the market. p
No doubt about it, this phone is everything the reviews say. A beautiful screen! Great sound! Great battery! I haven't noticed a lag at all (I clear my tasks regularly) this phone will offer a flagship experience-EDIT-After using the phone for a few months it's not the ultra flagship I accuses it of being initially. Still not bad but for the money there are better now. The CPU uses little.Big, allowing it to swap between a strong and weak quadcore solution to match the need...the issue...the weaker CPU cluster is seriously WEAK. Daily tasks and normal use suffers severely. Multitasking isn't superb with even 2 or 3 items open, and the biggest issue..The phone keeps going BERZERK! I have never dropped it, damaged. I've never broken even a screen on a smartphone in my life, so that's not it. This phone screen starts flickering, rapid image distortions, like I dropped it in a pool. Blue screens and fast flickers. n
Gets really hot when charging it. After a few android updates runs extremely slow. Very glitchy. The only thing good about this phone is the speakers. I would pass on this phone. Has a hard time multi tasking. Should have got the zenfone 2. n
It's a great phone! Makes a great gift! p
Awesome phone! I am ecExtremely pleased with my purchase if it and so glad I did some research and feel like I bought the best possible phone for the money spent. Very sturdy, actually comes with an instruction book and great headphones. So much better than ibuds! This is my first android phone and so not have any regrets! Highly recommend! I p
Phone is pretty good. Gets periodic updates and hopefully will be getting Marshmallow sometime in the near future, though I'm not sure when that will be. Good battery life, quick to charge. Nice screen, but I did also get a tempered glass protector.My only complaint is that it is a bit laggy. Sometimes when you click to launch an app or double tap to wake, it take the phone a second before anything starts to happen. It's kind of a pain when you think you touched something and are waiting for the app to open, only to find you have not actually touched it are are just staring at your phone like a goon. Still, for the pricepoint, it's a great phone. p
amazing phone p
Liked the phone. Screen and speakers were phenomenal. The performance for me was unacceptable the browser always bogged down and would freeze mid scroll, and the Bluetooth was horrendous. It would connect to my car then disconnect, so I've returned. n
this is my second idol 3/ I had the first for 4 months before I dropped it on concrete and cracked the glass (with armor glass installed). It is not intended to replace parts and the cost of replacement is more than would be worth it. I like the phone enough as an inexpensive smart phone that I ordered and received the replacement from amazon within 3 days (I paid for fast delivery). Quickly got up and running. A major feature is that the phone will accept up to 128GIGs of a mini memory card. I use this large memory to hold music, audible books, pictures and large spreadsheets. Unfortunately many apps (for example x-plore, do not recognize the added memory). My favorite picture viewer QuickPic does so without any problem.. p
I have the Alcatel Pop Icon that I bought on HSN a few months ago and like it alot, so when I read that Alcatel was coming out with their new flagship Idol 3 I couldn't wait to try it. I bought it on Amazon through Alcatel, it was very slow in coming, I wish I had waited until it was available on Amazon with Prime. The phone itself it terrific. Perfect size, beautiful screen, lightning fast, feels good in the hand, very light, couldn't ask for more! The price is great! Alcatel offers a wonderful product for a fantastic price. Just about everyone who has seen my new phone has ordered it for themselves. Very impressive. Would highly recommend. p
Shipping was a problem for me, it came 3 days later than it said it would. Other than that, I would definitively recommend this phone. It's essentially a cheaper version of the Galaxy series (I own one, so I can compare). Yes, you lose some of the features-- the camera isnt as good, etc-- but for less than half the price as the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6, the value is beyond comparison.The dual speakers are amazing and super loud, even at only half volume. Very clear. Awesome reversible UI so that you can have the phone in any orientation and use it, even for calls (look up a video for this). Runs Android Lollipop, so it's basically top tier. Battery life lasts me all day with very very heavy gaming use, and a few days with light to moderate use. No issues with the phone so far, or negatives other than the lack of a silencing option (also look up this bug on Android Lollipop for any phone you're looking at) p
Great built quality, nice looking phone, very thin and light weight, amazing audio quality, great camera, great screen. The only problem I had the first week of using it was that the WiFi was not working I tried everything to solve it and the only option I had was to factory reset it in order to make it work again which I wasn't very happy to do that. But over all its a great "mid / high end device" and you can't go wrong with this phone p
This is a ok phone. I got this phone in early offer for 200 dollar promotion. The phone comes with bells and whistles including headphones.After three week of use half of the touch screen stop responding. The full battery last for about 8 hours in regular use with occasional 1-2 mins video. I have noticed some problem while making call like other party don't hear you when you are talking. (occasional). n
Love it. Everything I'm looking for. Better than most flagship phones p
I like my phone for reasons that have already been stated more eloquently by others, so my review is going going to focus more on turning some of the dislikes I have read into likes:1.) Double Tap to Wake is not on by default. You need to enable it in the settings.2.) Double Tap to Wake is not 100% compatible with 3rd party launchers. It loses about 50% of its functionality on a 3rd party launcher IIRC. Personally, I was coming from the Google Now Launcher. (ProTip: I missed having the Google Now cards show when I swiped to the left of the home screen. One old work-around that I forgot existed is that I can just swipe up from the Home screen button (The 'O' button). Quick way to launch Google Now Launcher without making it the standard launcher or going to the app tray.) With that said, even on the Alcatel OneTouch Launcher, Double Tap to Wake is not 100% efficient. It is especially finicky when you try to use the feature to wake a phone that has entered deep sleep mode. However, if pushing the power button with your finger is a deal breaker, then that is some serious #FirstWorldProblems. I have no issues doing that one handed and my hands have never been big enough to palm a basketball.3.) Delete the (small amount of) bloatware to eliminate any unnecessary apps running in the background. This can assist in speeding up your phone if you are having issues. For example, I read that the AVG Anti-virus app specifically can cause a lot of lag on the phone since it is running in the background 24/7. Never had a need for Anti-virus scanner on Android yet so it was the first thing I trashed.4.) Personally I have been pleasantly surprised by the camera. Granted my previous phone had a mediocre camera, but still. One thing I've started doing that I've never done before is to tap the screen to focus the camera prior to taking pictures. This has been an Android feature for a while, but I just started using it and I really like how my photos are coming out, even at night. Alternatively, over at the Idol 3 XDA Forums, there are suggestions on other Camera apps to download, as well as manual settings to get the most out of your pictures if you are unhappy with the default options.5.) Try a factory reset if you are experiencing any issues after an OTA update. I think this is more to do with Lollipop than Alcatel because my other Android devices also were a little buggy after OTA updates to Lollipop until I completed a factory reset.If those suggestions do not address your concerns, Alcatel has confirmed via an email response to some XDA members that they are working on releasing another OTA update after reviewing feedback from the community.At the end of the day, many professional tech sites have stated that this is the budget phone of 2015 with good reason. Even if you think that professional reviewers are biased, here on Amazon, the current numbers as of 6/6/15 show 80% of Idol 3 reviewers gave the phone 4 stars or better. At the time of writing, the Amazon reviews of the OPO is 80% as well while the ZenFone 2 has 78% of reviews garnering 4 stars or better. p
So I am usually not rushing to write reviews, however, it doesn't take very much time to conclude that it is a somewhat mediocre device and falls terribly and disappointingly short of satisfaction. Consider this rating a scale from 1-3 stars and I'll explain why. Depending on what you are looking for in a cell phone, the rating will go up or down. At least this is what I have seen in other reviews. I'll cut to the chase:PRO1. SPEAKERS/JBL Sound system is AMAZING. To the point that music played on this thing out plays my lap top speakers! Believe it or not. You are carrying a mini boombox. Alcatel gets 5 star is this area. They can be too loud nonetheless so please be careful and considerate or you are going to sound like that person in a relatively nice SUV with a so so speaker system that rattles.5. Look is okay. My friend thought it was an I phone or something more expensive/high end. The phone is super light.2. Screen resolution is okay. Not 4k but c'mon it's HD. I am sorry to hear reviews from people that have received defect units.CON:3. THE DOUBLE TAP FUNCTION IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AN ALCATEL OR SOFTWARE PROBLEM. Most likely something to do with the device. All of these 4 and 5 stars received excellent/polished devices with no problems, which I find really hard to believe. This is annoying. You will just have to use the power button to turn on and off.6. SIM CARD DID NOT READ APPLICATIONS I HAD BEFORE AND OVERALL PHONE INTERFACE CAN TAKE TIME TO TAKE USE TO.6.5 I don't think Screen is scratch resistant.7. PHONE CAN BE SLUGGISH WHICH IS ANNOYING!!!. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS FROM A $250 DOLLAR PHONE. I HAVE AN OLD LG F6 Metro PCS phone and with all honesty, I don't know which is slower or faster at times. Some applications stopped working all together and I had to uninstall and install again. WTF<---!!! Really.*Caveat. My employer subsidized 50% of the cost which meant I only paid $125 out of pocket for this cell phone. BUT I am trying my best to be objective here and I can also say that I would not have paid $250 for this phone.which brings me to item number 8.8. coverage with AT&T drops randomly!!!!!!!. I DON"T CARE HOW MANY #1 or #2 STAR REVIEWS THIS PHONE HAS ON AMAZON. THIS along with the laggyness of the phone dropped this review from a solid 3 to a 2 star. A ONE STAR DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY BOOK OF REVIEWING. I was hesitant in rating this a 2 or 3 star but this made it clear. I am not crying about having 4gLTE 10000% percent of the time but when you can't hear someone because your bars just drop when other phones don't drop signal *in a good area with good reception (this statement compares other cell phones in the house) Just doesn't make sense.*second caveat. I don't pay for monthly service or service at all. BUT STILL, I WOULD NOT WANT TO PAY FOR SERVICE JUST TO HAVE A GOOD LOOKING TOY PHONE WITH GOOD SPEAKERS. NOPE. SORRY.This would be a better choice if the presale price of $200 stayed or if it was less because this is what this phone is worth. IN MY OPINION!!!9. CHIPSET and ram are a bit below mid range in terms of specs. Nothing great to be honest especially when we are entering the age of 3 and 4 Ram cell phones with Snapdragon chipsets in the 800 range and Melta kits etc.10. Battery life, at least in my case has not been impressive. I don't know if it's my device or what. But I have been using this phone not to slightly and not to heavy and it appears that the battery drains rather quickly compared to most of the reviews here and online that are boasting about this phones battery life.11.5 Phone gets warm to the point of hot near the camera when in use. Not even using for hours. Just using. This is alarming. Not sure if this is normal but again not cool.12. I don't know yet if I want to hassle and buy another phone and send this back, get my money, etc. Even though Amazon seems to do well with returns.13. I wonder if anyone else has this similar dilemma? Did anyone return it, get their money back and bought another Alcatel or something else?14. I hope my review helped someone out there. Go ahead and buy it, but please read some of the other reviews. Seems like some of us got a bad batch? Maybe. Go try your luck. this could have easily been a 3 or solid 4 star. I don't know about a 5 star. I am being honest but I am also picky. I did a lot of homework before getting here and even then I had some doubts. Guess you never know till you have one in your hands. GOOD LUCK YA'LL! n
I love this phone. I previously had a Galaxy Nexus on T-Mobile that was getting very long in tooth. If you have a phone on T-Mobile that doesn't have LTE, like Nexus 4, just get this phone already. Lots of areas down I-95 in North and South Carolina that don't have HSPA signals, only Edge or LTE. It was annoying my wife. She would be fuming about her slow connection on her Nexus 4, and I'm running a solid LTE signal.The only thing this doesn't have that the Nexus lines have is the wireless charging. This one has NFC for mobile payments or easily connecting Bluetooth devices, plus the addition of the microSD card slot, radio, good stereo speakers (although not the loudest), and a truly all day battery. This is a great value as well for $249.It's a big phone. I have large hands and find it hard to use one-handed. In return you get a huge screen that works well in bright Florida sun. It is surprisingly light though.One thing, without a case, I have large hands but my fingers would frequently touch the screen and cause the phone to do things unintentionally. I got one of the LK Ultra Jelly Series TPU Gel Rubber in clear frosted plastic, and it takes care of that problem. I would have gotten the manufacturers case, but it had sold out. p
So far I really like it considering the price. I switched from a Galaxy S4. My main love is the pure android feel of the device. SO much better than Samsung's touchwiz. Night and day improvement. Size is large, yet it doesn't seems abnormally large in my pocket. Slim and sleek. Good screen quality. Headphones are nice and a bonus. Mine work fine. Some said theirs don't work? Speakers in phone are great. Battery good. Reception and call quality seem good so far for me. I do seem to have one less bar than my s4 but haven't had connection issues.Cons: Doesn't appear to have a remote controller to control the TV. I liked that about the S4. I'll have to just get over that, but became used to that feature. Camera is ok. Seems about on par with the S4 which wasn't iphone quality but pretty decent unless indoors. Faster focus though. No home button. Instead just double tap the screen. Kind of like that, but it's taking some getting used to. Frequently the double tap lags or doesn't register to wake up device. Kind of annoying. Volume on the right also taking some getting used to. As with all unlocked devices, other than iPhone you can't get WiFi calling and texting on T-Mobile. Hope android fixes that soon.Overall I'd say I'm pleasantly surprised. It's much more enjoyable to use than the S4. I just got it last night so these are my quick observations. I can update more as I use it. The interface on this thing is amazing. More like an iPhone in pleasure and ease to use. Icons are live unlike the S4. Bye touchwiz! For $250 I can't imagine a better option.Update: I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because the more I use this the more I really like it. Was at 4 stars prior. Had some issues with my alarm clock not going off. I think I've fixed the issue now... hopefully. Called tech support today and they answered right away and helped me out. Kudos to Alcatel. Only major annoyance now is that I have to hit the power button to wake up the phone. I'm getting used to it, but not quite as convenient as a home button. The double tap only works 50% of the time so I've given up on it. Overall the interface on this phone is just a pleasure to use. p
Phone looks good, sounds good, and is even good to hold in the hand but has a tremendous amount of lag, takes too much time for apps to install, and most importantly, the signal reception on this device is TERRIBLE!!! I am constantly without service on this device. As soon as I pop out the sim and insert it into my G2 or Note 4, boom, I have full 4G LTE (I'm on AT&T). Double tap to wake almost never works. The unorthodox button placement is a PIA to get used to.I can understand the lag issue, with this being a budge device but come on Alcatel. This is 2015, phones shouldn't have reception problems these days (there's a reason we don't see the "can you hear me now" commercials...) n
Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this phone. p
This is a very decent phone for the price. It is well designed and feels good on hand. It is not $700 phone so don't expect a flagship phone. p
Love the phone. Great camera, memory, screen, etc. Only complaint is that text notifications seem to be inconsistent. Completely a SW issue though, is recommend this phone to anyone. p
I am fortunate to have only paid $100 for this phone back in September. Now the price is much higher but still well worth it.My other phone is a Motorola G3, third generation, the one that is somewhat waterproof, a unique quality of that phone. I have gone back and forth with these two phones and love both of them, but I always come back to the Alcatel. Since I am a musician I value one quality of this phone that very few phone orders give a hoot about, and that's the sound. The sound produced by the speakers of this phone is truly amazing considering that it is just a cell phone. My Moto G sounds tinny by comparison and my wife has a Moto X Pure and even hers can't begin to compare with the sound of the Alcatel. I also love the unique screen size, 4.7 inches, a nice, small size that is easy to manage and has excellent quality as well.The camera is every bit as capable as the Moto G and overall this phone is a most excellent phone, especially for the price. I would highly recommend this phone, and likely even some cheaper Alcatel phones based on the quality of this one. p
Minus the negative reviews I thought i'd give my opinions to crack down on the phone if you want a basic 16gb phone this is not really that bad it loads youtube really well and the camera feels like it tracks your height. Minus a white UI or User Interface for noobs all you have to do is install a launcher I'd prefer the Samsung S6 style because it turns the UI 100% transparent for my first phone I am satisfied. There's only one flaw is the guide book strictly tells you not to use it so much to retain its full performance speed and the battery might over heat any way so it's recommended to NOT constantly keep it on.Don't be confused because I told you the battery heats because any battery in a phone can over heat and catch fire, Sadly phones are not build with micro cooling fans which can cool down the device unless you get a phone case that supports a built in cooling fan. I would recommend a grip case though because the phone is slick. Also watch out because the phone screen its self is actually glass which is possibly fragile but has a good quality display that I really like and YES it is HD!If you get this phone make sure you also get a screen protector and I'd recommend a stylist if you're worried about smudge marks it also prevents others from seeing your pin code or drag lock code. The phone also fits with the Homido VR Head Display and can support virtual reality because it has a gyroscope and 360 tracking. I really love watching anime with it and can't wait to get it activated the only issue I had was it did not load youtube repeater that well so any way to end this I will say it's pretty good for a standard phone but if you want more performance go with a 32gb phone or above but for 16gb this phone is worth it and for the price. p
Arrived fast. Great for that price. p
It's nice that this phone has LTE and it functions okay. I installed a different launcher because the one that came stock was not that great. My bottom volume button stopped functioning after a few weeks, which was a bummer, but with the reversible function, I can just rotate it and get my bottom volume button to work. n
I was astonished that a phone as inexpensive as this would work so well for me! I have virtually used more expensive Samsung phones since I have had a cell phone. Because I had a Note 7, I was waiting for another good phone to come along. I bought this for a backup/second phone figuring that I would use it for a short while. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles, or stylus, but it is a reasonable phone to have if you are on a budget. I'm no techie, but I like it as a good, inexpensive, usable phone! p
It scratches easy, the screen protector they sent doesn't work properly... it fell today now the digitizer is gone....it over heats with the battery....worst luck ever with phones n
My siblings, coworkers, and even my friends wants to buy this phone from me as soon as I unbox it and setting up the phone. I love how big it is, the system runs smooth and its everything it says on the description. I love the phone and fits my style for a great price. :) p
Great build quality. Almost stock Android. Little laggy performance. Good battery life. p
There are an awful lot of Androids out there, plus other phones built on differing operating platforms . . . but this one is a standout.With the use of a SIM card you need not be tied to an expensiv 'minutes you'll never use' monthly plan. I spend $25 every 3 months on a AT+T GoPhone account - SIM only - but don't burn data on it . . . I use wifi signals whether I am at home or traveling. In 3 years I have saved $1,800!I've had the phone less than a week, and these are my observations thus far . . .THE GOOD+ Dual-band (2.4GHz / 5GHz) for wifi . . . Netflix is SNAPPY on the 5ghz band of my home router. Downloading huge maps for offline use is also ZIPPY. Disable your data function!+ Adjustable screen brightness+ The cost. I would have liked to have paid less, who wouldn't!, but this phone is a long term investment, and money well spent. If you're on one of the 'big boys' data plans, then the Idol is couch change to you.+ The camera: 13 mp front, and 8 mp rear. Nice quality, and being a photographer I know what I'm talking about. Low light? I saw one review stating that the camera function was poor in low light. Pffft!+ Video: 1080p high def. Gorgeous.+ Accessories: The screen protector, holster and the gel-like skin were all $10 each or less from Amazon.+ Display: 5.5" is plenty big enough for reading, playing or watching movies.+ Audio: Seriously, the JBL speakers couldn't be better.+ Storage: 16gb, plus if you need it you can add a MicroSD card up to 128gb in size.+ As it's an unlocked GSM phone with a SIM, it can be used globally by purchasing a local SIM when you arrive. I've been doing that for years with my old Android.THE BAD [not really]- Power switch is on the side not the top, so I often adjust the side-mounted volume controls by accident- You can't switch to a fresh battery if need be, but that said I never used the back-up battery with my previous phone.Talking of my previous phone, it was a Chinese Android knock-off - the Star V1277 - so in comparison you're probably thinking that I'm easy to please.You're right, but so will you be if you purchase this phone! p
I bought this phone after having used an iPhone 5 for 2.5 years. I'm no phone expert but I have owned several smart phones including the original Samsung Galaxy, and iPhone 3, and the aforementioned iPhone5. The reason I chose this phone was the specs and the decent price. I paid 250 with a 10% discount from Amazon which reduced it to 225. For an unlocked phone that performs decently that is a good deal. My thoughts about the phone below.The good stuff: The phone itself feels solid. I like the front facing speakers - they provide good sound. The screen is good. It's bright and big and does what it's supposed to do. The back of the phone doesn't feel like plastic, although it probably is. The fact that I still can't tell three weeks into it should tell you all you need to know about that. The size of the phone was a bit daunting when I started using it (iPhone 5 is tiny compared to this phone) but it's grown on me. I can finally read comfortably using a phone. That means I use my tablet less. Finding apps is not a problem. Google apps seem to work just a little bit better on Android, although that shouldn't be a surprise. My wi-fi connectivity works great, and the phone calls I make sound clearer than my old iPhone. The 4G/LTE connectivity seems to work better too although I can't prove it.The bad: The phone is noticeably slow when starting apps. The wait time to start apps is measured in seconds and it's annoying. If you buy this phone, buy the one with 4GB RAM. One nice feature that really helps me is being able to shut down all open applications with one button click something the iPhone never had. Another bad thing are the button locations. The power button and the volume buttons are on opposite sides of the phone at the same level so when I push the button to shut off the screen I end up squeezing both sides of the phone which takes a screen shot. I can't even tell you how many screen shots I've mistakenly taken. Not a huge deal, but again, annoying. I don't particularly like where Android puts all it's system settings, but that's a personal nit since I'm still acclimating to the Android.Bottom line: It's a good unlocked phone at an affordable price. I'd recommend it with the caveats I mentioned. p
Very much content with the phone. Works really good. p
Screen died on me 1 week after purchasing. The screen suddenly started to display stripes and the colors are completely off. Phone was generally good but I did experience the gentle lag that all the reviews refer to. Not a deal-breaker, but noticeable. The issue with the screen did however prompt me to return the phone because I don't have a lot of confidence this phone will hold up based on the sudden change of the screen quality. I've been trying the mid-range, well rated phones of late and had no luck with this one as well as the Asus Zenfone2, so I guess I'll have to continuing searching or suck it up and just get an unlocked iPhone if I want something a little more relaible. I want to love this phone, it's almost there, the headphones are really good, the screen was great before it crapped out, but I just don't want to putz around troubleshooting something I just bought. Better luck next time I hope... n
I am a tech junkie, and this is one of the best cell phones I've ever used. The screen is beautiful, the look and feel is very premium, the speakers are the best I've heard on any mobile device, and the software is the perfect blend of stock Android and some very useful customizations (the feature that flips the screen orientation is really cool). Seriously, the speaker is outstanding - music sounds incredible and I now love to use the speakerphone. The ONLY complaints I have about it are that it is sometimes a TAD bit slower than the flagship phones in opening a program or doing a task, and the camera sometimes has grainy images in low light or when you zoom in. But even then, I compared it with other phones, and I'd say the pictures are only 5%-10% more noisy than the best ones, so it's not a big deal. Plus the shutter speed is really fast. And I like that the LED flash is a more yellow color which leads to more natural toned pictures taken with the flash.The button placement, as people have mentioned, is a little weird, but it is not a big deal and you get used to it quickly. p
Very good device I've had it for a few days so far so good. I love the speakers and the screen and front facing Speaker's are awesome for media comsuption and getting LTE on ATT by way of straight talk. All in all if your looking for a phone that's tech heavy that you can root and play graphic heavy games without lag get he asus 4gb or the one plus , but if you just like me just wanted a good around phone that has a beautiful screen and great speakers and get LTE and a good battery life get this p
Wow-wee I love this Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 phone! I've had it for week now and it does everything I want.The phone, Billy, showed up within 24 hours of being ordered - one of the perks of Amazon Prime. It arrived in great condition.I use Billy on a T-Mobile pay-as-you go plan and the T-Mobile store was able to transfer my contacts over from my old Blackberry phone. They were also able to cut down my large size SIM card to fit the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 small SIM card format. They also fit in my old 8GB memory card without trouble. They said the passcode had to be turned off to transfer the contacts and this phone does not allow the passcode to be turned off, but they were able to transfer everything over OK.To make full use of the features of this phone I had to create a free Google account, which was no big deal. It is not required to use the phone, but it makes it easier to use the built in Google apps.The text messaging interface works nicely and seems to be adapting to my style and word choice. It suggests the next word and is getting better and better and predicting what I am trying to say which makes texting faster.The camera takes amazing pictures with crystal clarity. I'm really impressed with the quality of pictures it takes. Speaking of clarity, I've watched a couple of YouTube videos on it and I was blown away. The resolution and crispness of the colors is better than my television and the sound it fantastic.I also got a FitBit and I really enjoy monitoring my progress on this phone.The battery lasts me throughout the day although the battery is low by the end on the day. My old Blackberry would last for 3 days before it needed a charge, although I would charge it every night. But to be fair, with all the increased features on this phone, I'm using Billy a lot more. It is also much bigger than my old phone. I used to wear my old phone on a holster on my belt, but that doesn't seem practical with a phone of this size. It generally fits in my deeper trouser pockets OK.Overall a great phone and I really love it. p
Had issues on the start up. Randomly restarted. Once up and running a little sluggish, but you get what you pay for. p
Writing this review on the idol 3 and the phone is great so far. Battery has been solid, apps work silky smooth, and reception is great on it. Seems to be very well built and it is an absolute steal for the price. Don't know how durable it is, but with a case it should hold up just fine. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an amazing budget friendly smartphone. p
Excellent p
This is an awesome device for the price. Feels good in hand. Great display even in sunlight. Loud audio. Really cool software features. Pretty fast. Noticed a little stutter when downloading a web page with multiple embedded mixed media. Did not try any games on it. Double tap sleep was great. Double tap wake worked <50% of the time. Minimal bloatware. A pleasure to use!The problem: Using this on T-mobile, I could not get a good enough signal in my house to make or receive calls and texts. Figured that it wasn't a carrier issue since my kids (in same house with same carrier) had no issues with cell reception on their Moto X (2013) and Samsung Galaxy S5. It wasn't a SIM card issue, I put it in my 9.7 inch Chinese phone tablet that wasn't meant to be used in the U.S. and I was able to get a strong, consistent 3G signal and make calls from it with good clarity. My phone seemed locked to finding an LTE signal, and instead of dropping to 3G or 2G connections, it would simply not connect at all. Through 95% of the house I would get No signal or Emergency calls only mode. If I changed settings to 3G only or 2G only I could sometimes get a good signal for a while, but then it would suddenly disappear even when the phone isn't moved (sitting on the table). I lost signal completely at a local Subway, at my doctor's office, and had a call cutoff a couple times while sitting at a mall parking lot. I need my kids to be able to reach me at all times in case of emergency.Signal strength on this phone throughout my house would be about -125dBm and 99 asu while on LTE or no signal at all. I got a Samsung Galaxy S4 on sale for $299 and was able to connect consistently throughout the house. It's LTE signal strength was about -115 dBm and 35 asu, so the Idol 3 was about -10 dBm worse and hence no calls. Right now the S4 switched down to HSPA with -105 dBm and 4 asu. The Idol 3 would never switch down, just lose connection. Not sure if that is a problem with my specific phone or a general software issue. The Galaxy S4 can also make wifi calls, so I kept the S4 and returned the Idol 3.I had great connectivity on the Idol 3 at work and in an adjacent city, so if you live in an area with good coverage and won't venture out of the area much, then this phone may work great for you.While sorting through this issue, Alcatel was very responsive to my emails, so +1 to the seller. I hope their next phone has a better antenna and is wifi-enabled for calls, because I really liked this device. I really wanted it to work for me, but bottom line, the best phone for me is one that can keep a connection with my carrier in my area so that I can make and receive calls and texts. A phone that can't make calls is useless to me.For those of you who have great reception, you've got a good device at a great price! n
So much for the joys of unlocked phones. Regardless whether I let Android automatically detect network or I manually choose any of the 3 discovered MetroPcs networks, I receive error the "SIM Card Not Permitted to Connect" to network. Went to YouTube and created a few custom APNs to no avail. Alcatel .pdf says all you need to do is plop in the SIM, your micro flash and let Android do the rest. 250 dollar brick at the moment. Returned the SIM back to the old phone and all is well. Not the experience I expected, having read the Alcatel guide online.**Update: Replacement phone has no Chinese-language error messages. That was first hint that initial phone had some unusual problem. Amazon returns are very easy and as soon as box was in UPS queue the refund was issued (same day). Metro would not associate phone ID with network without purchase of a new $26 dollar SIM card from the store. I would think an active SIM from previous device associated with new device should work, but I would be mistaken. That's how they roll, apparently. Their rationale is that stolen phones on their network are their bane and this procedure makes their lives easier by associating one phone per card--whatever. How nice for them. Folks at company-owned store were polite and efficient about it, though. Phone, itself, is pretty good. If the "Recent Apps" screen had no esoteric animation, there would be no performance lags to report. Launching and switching between apps is quick. Great media device. Handles everything I throw at it with ease. While the Sony hardware is so-so, it looks like the preloaded software isn't the best, either. Swap out the installed Camera app with after-market one and the reported camera deficiencies are improved, even in lower light. For $250 bucks it's hard to beat for average use. Cell phone connoisseurs will never like this phone so ignore the hate. n
A really great phone. Only the headphones don't work on the phone. Works on other phones. But not on this phone. My Bose works on this my Sony works on this phone but not the one included. Yet the included headphone works on my iPhone 6. ????? Go figure.Over all a great phone hit the price. p
Nice phone, sounds amazing I recomend it p
Excellent battery life that lasts a day of hard usage, survived a 4 foot drop onto a wood floor, very good audio, and a mostly lag free experience.The only flaw would be the lack of Wi Fi calling with T mobile p
Summary:Just an amazing phone for any price range.I have been using my Idol 3 for about 4 days now and I must say I am loving everything about it. People all over the net keep talking about just how great the screen and speakers are. I can't stress this enough they are both truly amazing. I am coming from the OnePlus One and although on paper the OPO has slightly better specs all around. I think that Alcatel did a much better job of implementing android more so then CM did. I stress this because basic functionality just operates so much smoother. For example typing. Typing just about anywhere whether it be writing an email or texting or whatever, is just extremely responsive. After having used my OPO for almost a year I had gotten used to having to type a little slow. On the IDOL 3 I can speed type again which means I can get more work emails done faster this I love! I don't see to many people talk about this fact but the screen is very responsive as well as it is bright. This is also my first phone with front facing speakers. All I can say is wow what a difference that makes. I watch a lot of videos on my phone and it does really enhance the experience all around. The phone itself is actually smaller than the OPO as well as it is thinner. It feels very sturdy and portable I put a screen protector and case on my and it is still very pocketable. Also a lot of people are asking about updates. Well I too am a little concerned about updates. However right out of the box I received one OTA update of around 50mb which I installed right away. Every now and then you see a little lag if you are a heavy multi tasker like I am. But I feel confident that this is related to crappy lollipop 5.0.2 and that once this guy gets the latest 5.1.1 those issues should be all smoothed out as 5.1.1 is know to perform quite a bit better and isnt supposed to have the memory leaks found in 5.0.1. My only other is the double tap to wake. This feature works here and there and isnt very reliable. I am sure they could fix this in a software update. p
I purchased this phone for my uncle.IIRC, this phone only has 4~5 Language selections.English (US), English (UK), French, Spanish, and I don't remember the rest.The thing is android OS has many languages available on its root,yet Alcatel purposely disabled the rest of the languages and made them unavailable.It was for my uncle who doesn't read English well, and I was surprised that Alcatel tweaked the OS to make a lot of languages unavailable. n
It's a great phone and an awesome value. Was stepping up from a Nexus 4. It's pretty close to stock Android with some minor tweaks to the UI - which I didn't mind. Battery life was pretty good (I could go a couple days with medium usage). The screen is crisp and bright. Sounds were loud and clear. And that brings me to a minor issue I had with the ringer and notification volumes: At the lowest level they were a bit too loud. Call quality and data speeds were great. I did experience occasional sluggishness when opening and switching between apps. As I used it for a couple of days, I struggled to get used to the power button on the left and the volume rocker on the right (it's completely opposite of the Nexus 4). This, combined with the larger size made it awkward to turn on/off and adjust volumes. I thought I would enjoy a larger device with the 5.5" screen, but I just couldn't get used to it. Perhaps, if I kept using it, I would eventually get used to it. But why compromise? I'd rather buy a device and love it from the get go. Welcome back Nexus 4! For me, I think the 4.7" screen is the perfect size. I still recommend this phone. p
I am on a iPhone 5s currently, which I use for my daily use and workouts, coz of the small size. But because of that I am not able to read properly. So, instead of getting a tablet I opted for the idol 3, given the price and good screen size.I am happy with it. I use it for reading and the size is just right.+great screen and brightness+decent battery+speakers are excellent+included JBL earphones are very good+premium finish+very thin bezel all around.-Slippery in my hands, needs a case for sure-there's an ever so slight delay, not bothersome, but it's a tad slow if you are coming from a snapdragon 801/805 processor. p
Great Phone p
I have gone through a Samsung Galaxy S5 , an IPhone 6 plus , an Lg G2 and now landed on this ALCATEL ONE TOUCH IDOL 3 phone all within the last 8 months , having used high end devices , I did not have too high of expectations from the Idol 3 as it only cost $199 at the pre order special price . I have been playing with it for the last two days and below are my impressions .Pros : the biggest one is how much device you are getting for your money , this phone has a large 5.5 inch 1080p display , JBL tuned front firing stereo speakers that sound great , a 3000maH battery , heck it even comes with rather nice JBL earbuds in a nice package , these are specs you will find on devices that cost much more from other well known brands . the build quality is just fine , the phone feels nice in the hands , the software is well done with Android Lollipop running almost stock with very little customization done from Alcatel and not much bloatware. the display has rather accurate colors and looks sharp just like any other flagship device , the 13 Mp main camera is not the best in the business but pictures look sharp in well lit places and okay for low light ones . the front facing camera is just okay as well . you can perform almost all tasks on this phone without any slowness for the most part (see cons ) and this is where I should get in to the cons .Cons: so what is the catch , I mean there has to be one for a device that costs less then half the amount of a flagship device from other Major brands , well for one thing the Octa Core Qualcom 615 processor used in this phone might sound mighty on paper but the fact is that it is an outdated processor by today's standards , although it performs most tasks just fine , you will find stutter and slowness while browsing the web in the browser and in some apps , it is also not the best device for gaming . the battery specs also look great on paper but so far I have been rather underwhelmed by it with Lg G2 outlasting this phones battery by hours , I hope that the battery will get better with a few more charge cycles . overall all though it is a fantastic device for very little money , if you watch youtube , movies or listen to lots of music on your phone then you will love the front facing speakers , just do not expect this device to be as fast as the $700 phones out today and you will be just fine . p
Love the phone for the price. Changing the standard icons seems a little silly and it definitely runs hot, but I am happy with it overall.Update: My son thought my phone needed water so RIP Idol 3. Had bring your own device family plan insurance through AT&T(needed it on phone purchased via Next). The claim with Asurion was a HOT mess. This phone was not on their "list" of devices and they really don't have any infrastructure for a non flagship phone. Their replacement of like quality was an LG G Flex 2. They charged a tier 3($200) deductible and had no way to appeal that decision. Seriously, 71% deductible. AT&T and Asurion played hot potato about the $200 deductible and I ended up filing Dept of Insurance and FTC complaints.So, long story short either assume the risk and don't get insurance on this phone or insure it via anyone but Asurion. SquareTrade has a $75 flat deductible, repair instead of replace options, and costs less than AT&T/Asurion too p
I really like this phone. The screen is beautiful! The rear camera is excellent! The whole thing is very zippy.The downside is that average real use is only about 14-18 hours on a full charge. You MUST plug it in every night or it will be dead in the morning. If you had a particularly full day of cellular data use, I think the above numbers would be halved down to 7-9 hours. p
I showed it to my friends whom have never heard about it, they could not believe the Alcatel can put in a such flagship qualities on very affordable price. Phone runs pretty fast and smooth on every apps that i throw at.it. T-mobile LTE and SMS work nicely our of the box. JBL speakers are very clear and crisp.I'm debating with myself about whether to keep it or go for a better deal on the Asus Zenfone 2 (64 GB and 4 GB memory version)Any references? p
This is the best bang for your buck phone.$250 no tax ( I ordered when it was 1 day promo at $199)This phone is the best phone for the person who uses the phone for phone calls, email, social media, browsing and messaging.If you take a lot of photos from back camera, you may want to tapper your expectations. Front camera is OKThis phone's sound quality for media (music apps/ YouTube etc) is the best one I have used and it beats my note 4. It uses jbl stereo speakers which produces amazing sound. You will not need your Bluetooth speaks for park or BBQ.Gaming is not that good and there is a little lag for heavy duty apps.This phone is better than lg g3, nexus 5, galaxy s5 or HTC m8 and other last year's flagship models.If camera is not the priority, I use this over one plus one. It is better than moto g and previous moto x.It's not going to compete with s6 note 4 or nexus 6 or m9.Microsd slot is a plus for some but removable battery and lack of quick charge is a minus for many. IDC about removable battery.Given the price I paid ($200), I am a satisfied customer and would recommend anyone who plans to buy a budget smartphone. Why pay $650 if you are going to use your phone for tasks which do not require the high end specs. p
Throughout my lifetime, the prices on consumer electronics have dropped steadily as capability and quality rises. Smartphones have been an exception, largely because of the subsidy model, and something that acts as a good quality tablet but with data connection and the ability to make phone calls could easily run you close to $800. That puts this Alcatel Onetouch clearly in the budget category, despite being more expensive than a tablet or moderate sized television.These days many carriers are moving away from the subsidy model, and those who are looking for less expensive phones were stuck with ones that were far less capable. Alcatel has changed that with this phone. While it won't compete with the latest high end models on today's market, it has power and capability that even high end phones lacked even a few years ago. This "unlocked" phone is technically a non-locked phone. It's not loaded with a slew of apps from a specific provider and even lets you get rid of some default apps that you may not want. An important thing for any device not tied to any specific carrier is compatibility. This phone covers all the bands needed for carriers such as AT&T or T-Mobile or any other that uses a SIM, and that includes 4G and LTE bands.It gives you 16GB of memory, with about 10GB available for user content. It also supports a microSD card, for up to 128GB more. It takes a micro SIM, which is fairly standard these days. It gives you a fast Octa-Core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, which I found responsive. I haven't tested it with video games that are extremely CPU or graphically intensive, but for typical tasks there should be no lag. You get very good sound for built in speakers, and the phone works just as well when you flip it over, even for phone calls.The cameras are very good resolution for an inexpensive phone, and are better than what even high end ones had a few years ago. But you don't get any special frills or controls for exposure. You get a good 13MP camera and an 8MP front facing camera, both of which beat what you find on other inexpensive phones, and both can rival cameras on better phones for outdoor daylight photos. For low light situations, you will get adequate pictures but not at the level of high end devices. You also get 1080p video. One of the big advantages of the video button is that it starts taking video and stops taking video. On other cameras, it will switch you to video mode, but why? All that accomplishes is letting you share the shutter button, which offers little value and is especially awkward if you want to take landscape videos. With this phone, the video button is in a logical place for landscape video, there's no reason to switch modes, and your shutter button still works for still photos. That way you can take video much faster without waiting to switch modes, and the button will work for those holdouts who still insist on vertical videos.I haven't torture tested it, but the glass is supposed to be highly scratch resistant and more breakage resistant than for typical phones. The phone itself doesn't have the look or feel of a cheap phone. Phone screens have been growing larger, and this one gives you a 5.5 inch screen. Personally I could make do with a smaller screen, but companies make phones with smaller screens that sacrifice capability in many other ways and Alcatel is no exception.A few things I don't like about the phone are that the battery isn't removable. That might not be a long term problem since battery life is pretty good. I also don't like the offset USB connector on the bottom since it makes it awkward to use the built in cradle in my car. This is a disadvantage compared to what works well for companies such as Samsung or Apple. The other thing that's apparently missing is WiFi calling for T-Mobile. Google now has a Hangouts dialer, which can accomplish the same thing and aside from caller ID not pointing to your primary number that could be a workaround.Other issues have to do with support. The phone has been out long enough now that the company should have phone-specific support information on its website, but it's still not there. This phone doesn't show up on the list on the support page. That means there are no downloads or phone specific FAQs. The phone comes with a Quick Start Guide, but no user manual and there's none on the website.UPDATE: There is still no link to a user manual on their website, but customer service was able to send me a URL for one. There are some features that need further explanation and I was hoping that the user manual would cover them. For example, the status LED doesn't work like the one on other phones or have colors to indicate anything. The phone has a setting to turn it on or off. You'd expect the manual to tell you what the LED indicates, but all the manual says about that setting is "Touch to turn on/off the LED indicator." If you want to know how the time lapse feature for the camera works, the manual says "Touch to enable Time-lapse" when describing the setting, but that's already obvious.Overall, you get a lot for your money. It may not be the highest end phone out there, but the big companies better look over their shoulders. It beats what they offer at this price point and I wouldn't be surprised if this company has something that is truly competitive with the competition's top of the line in the near future. p
Very good product! An improvement over my 2 year old moto g no doubt. My one and only issue so far is that sometimes it doesn't respond right away opening an app p
Take a step back and think about this thing. It has an identical screen to, and RAM of, an Iphone 6 Plus, for a sixth the price. Pop in an SD for more storage. Similar or better form factor too, with nice stereo speakers and better earbuds than an Iphone. Performance is smooth, and it updated immediately to Marshmallow. What's not to like?I guess one thing. Reports around the web indicate the screen may crack under light pressure/drops. So get a case and screen protector. Because this is an older model phone, both can be found cheap at the usual suspects. p
Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you p
Gracias, excelente. p
Buy from $100 worth the money! Speaker is great , and can upgrade to 6.0.Available language is not enough.No other problem yet p
I love this phone! By the way, if you are looking for other cases for it I be using the blue vivo xl cases. It fit but the headphone Jack is a little off. Also, the buttons on the sides is off to but you can set this phone to turn on and off by tapping the screen( Which is a plus). But that's just what I use. The phone is love! p
Excellent value for price,Decent phone. p
Exelente p
Have only had this phone for sub two weeks and have had nothing but issues out of the box. Constant freezing and crashing, i cant even use certain apps, my photos don't load and the phone straight up goes black screen and restarts at least once a day. Very unhappy customer at this point in time. n
Great screen, slim and light. Occasionally gets quite warm. The reason for two stars is durability, it has none. The power switch quit after 14 months on the first phone. I've owned 20 or so phones and never had a power switch quit on me. I bought a second phone for a family member and the screen auto cracked. This is likely the reason it is only $100 now versus $240 a year ago. Great phone but do not expect it to last for more than a year. n
seems more stable than my old gen 1 Moto G but because of the location of the volume and power button I am constantly accidently doing screen captures. I am still trying to adapt to the new version of Android and how the phone it self works. I don't like the white background in the app menu, white uses a lot more juice making the battery deplete quicker. The feel has me missing my Moto G. I like the thicker body of the G but really like the Idols excellent speakers and can handle more storage than the Moto. p
I've used a lot of high-end smart phones, including Samsung, Apple, Google Nexus, and LG. I had to buy this phone for a consulting project, and I wound up liking it so much, I returned my Google Nexus 5X, and bought another of these as my phone. It has expandable storage (micro-SD) which was important to me. It has surprisingly good (better than Nexus 5x) battery life. It does not have typical high-end phone bloatware installed.I would have given this 5 stars but the camera is just not up to par with the best of the smartphones (should it be for $250??).I would have preferred a 5.2" screen (over its 5.5") but that is just me. All in all, this is a great phone. p
Great! p
I've had this phone for 3.5 months now and am thoroughly disappointed with it. It doesn't multitask very well. Freezes up at the most inopportune times. And has begun restarting itself randomly throughout the day! Save your money!!!! n
Screen cracked less then a month after I bought it. I either emailed or called Alcatel two months later because I was in a remote location without the ability to pack something and ship it. They said their was nothing they could do except charge me for a repair. Really disappointed cause I was looking forward to using it but it is unusable since the lower half of the screen is unresponsive. n
This is my first Alcatel OneTouch phone. These are what I've experienced during my usage.I bought this phone because my brother's iPhone 4s was too slow and too small. He already used an Android device, but he feels more comfortable on iOS.Pros1. Thin and lightweight design (not my kind of thing, but most people would like it)2. Great display (almost rivals the $389 OnePlus 2, which is my daily driver)3. Loud speakers (louder than the Galaxy S6, the LG G4, and the OnePlus 2, but not as loud as the HTC One M9, the Moto X Pure Edition, and the Nexus 6P)4. Nice battery life (better than the Galaxy S6, but not as good as the Nexus 6P)5. Clean UI (uninstallable bloatware, stock Android-like interface)Cons1. Average performance (1.5GHz octa-core S615, 2GB RAM is not as good as the Asus Zenfone 2 and the OnePlus X)2. Average rear-facing camera (colors are dull, focus is slow)3. Charging speed (2 and 1/10 hours)4. Bloatware (even though it can be uninstalled, it'd be nice if it just didn't come with it)5. Not durable enough (doesn't feel robust and dependable)6. Price (it needs to be $200)So, it's an overall okay phone for the price, but I would go with the Zenfone 2 or the OnePlus X. Also, for $199.99, the Honor 5X has very similar specs to the Idol 3 5.5". So, I wouldn't fault you if you just bought one, but you can do better. n
The best.phone for the price.haha. p
I bought this phone because of the reviews I seen here and because of the price for the specs this phone has. After 5 months of use I can say definitely say that this phone is a huge disappointment.The Idol 3 has a nice big 1080p display which looks great, 2 GB of RAM, a decent processor, slim sleek design, and a mostly bloat-free stock Android OS. Unfortunately, the software is horribly unoptimized because this phone suffers from lots of performance issues. Lag when watching videos on YouTube, blurry pictures with the camera, and apps taking ages to open up are some examples.I had my phone bricked when trying to take a system update so I set up a warranty repair on their website and overnighted my phone to Alcatel. Only to have it returned to me 3 days later unrepaired because my phone had "water damage". My phone has been in a case since day 1 and has never been submerged in or splashed with water. Clearly they don't want to honor their warranty.Pair that with the fact that this phone rarely gets patches and will likely never be updated to Android 6.0 and I recommend paying a little more for a Galaxy, LG, or Nexus phone. n
Very nice phone. Fast and really good looking. Have gotten many compliments. Nice camera. Good phone overall! p
I'm an IT professional, although I'm also a single dad of 3. So price is the main thing here. This is the best phone... For the price I could get. I love it! Camera is great. Compared to me friends LG V10. I have almost all the hardware for less than half the price. The speakers are the best Ive ever heard on a phone in the mid or flagship range. No overly loud but stereo quality is excellent. The LCD display is amazing for what it is. No 4k was not a deal breaker for me 1080p is more than enough. I've dropped it at least 20 times and there is not even a scratch. EvoCel case. With TMobile the quality is off the charts compared to my old S4 and Lumia 640. If your on a budget you cant get much more for the price! p
I really, really wanted to like this phone. The screen is just fantastic and the speakers are amazing. It absolutely blows away my Moto X 2014 in that regard. The processor is OK, there's a bit of lag here and there but it's not overwhelming and something you can easily live with. The battery life seemed to be really fantastic, and it was a mostly great device.I only ran into problems when it comes to using it as a phone. Calls sound muddy, and everyone who I spoke to had issues understanding me. Coming from my Moto X, which had fantastic call quality, this was very disappointing. Using the phone in speakerphone mode didn't help at all, if anything, it made it worse! I've also noticed it struggled with signal strength in the same areas where the X had no issue, consistently pulling a signal that was anywhere between 5-7 dBm worse than the X.Maybe I got a bad device, but in reading more reviews I've noticed that muffled calls and signal issues seem to be commonplace. Honestly, a slightly better microphone and antenna would make this a killer phone. If your goal is to use the browser and apps, you'll be fine with this phone. If you plan on anything more than occasional call, I'd look for something else. n
I purchased this phone a few weeks ago but wanted to wait until Alcatels update before I posted a review. Pre update this phone was 4 stars tops. Post update it's a 5. You may have noticed other reviews knock the double tap feature. That's been completely fixed. The camera is better and lag is nearly non existent.Pros1) the front speakers are as good as advertised - I've tested them with my HTC m8 and they are easily on par with boomsound (without the infamous bezel).2) battery life is insanely good3) screen quality and brightness is top notch4) I LOVE the reversible screen. It's not a gimmick and actually is useful, especially when I have a headphone jack plugged in. I can now decide if I want the headphones jack to be on the bottom or the top.5) SD expansion. Enough said.6) near stock Android. I don't feel the need to add a launcher like I did with previous Samsung phones (s4, s5)7) cool features like a compass and fm radioCons1) music tends hiccup every now and then. Doesn't matter which player I'm using or how I'm listening (headphones or directly through the speakers). Was hoping that the update would fix but it didn't. Hopefully a future update will.2) no IR. I get it, it's a $250 phone so this is nitpicking honestly3) wish the battery was removable. This used to be a deal breaker for me but it seems to be the trend nowadays. Learning to deal.The camera is neither a pro or a con for me. It's not as good as the s6, g4 or even the s5. But it is as good or better than the m8 (don't know about the m9). It isn't bad by any stretch... Especially outdoors. (Sony lens).Bottom line is I love this phone. I'm sold and simply can't justify $700 or $800 for other flagships nor can I justify subsidizing or anything like that any longer. The idol 3, zenphone and moto g seem to be setting a trend in the smartphone world and it's exciting stuff. So glad I picked this up!EDIT: 6 months in and I'm sill loving this phone for all of the reasons above. Hoping for a Marshmallow update and now looking forward to a (hopefully soon) announcement for the idol 4. p
Love the phone. Had a iPhone 4 and galaxy s3. This Alcatel is better in every way. Battery, speakers, flip screen. Etc. If I ever need I'll be buying Alcatel again. p
I upgraded from the galaxy s3, by taking a leap of faith and buying the Alcatel onetouch3 (and a 64 GB micro SD). My gamble paid off, this product has, so far, exceeded expectations.For the basic smartphone user, it has every feature you need, including a flash on the camera. There's no removable battery, but I'm sure it will last at least 2 years regardless. If you're like me and don't need top end features but want a good android phone at a reasonable price, I'm pretty sure you wont be disappointed going with this phone.For you hardcore phone-o-files, its basically a no frills new android os and the no frills means no bloatware, fast load/response times and a solid day on the battery usage. I'm sure it's highly customizable for those that enjoy modding the os. p
I've been playing with the phone for only a day. The Nexus 4 is my previous phone. There are many review articles and videos online about the Idol 3. Each stating about the same thing. Good enough but not great processing power. Good but not great camera. Close to stock Android. Big, bright and clear display. Poor button placement. I just wanted to comment on the many reviews that say the buttons are too high. I think the designers took into account that this smartphone will be handled by two hands by most people. Holding it in your left hand and using your right to navigate positions the buttons perfectly. Your left thumb is on the power with the left index on the volume. So people who buy this phone knowing to use two hands and they want value for their dollar... They'll find it difficult to beat this one. I for one am very happy with the product so far. p
If your a smart person and you are looking for a smartphone, this is the right phone for you! The Idol 3 is not a high-end smartphone like the samsung galaxy s6 or the lg g4, but it does deliver some pretty good performances and specs for the average user and you get this phone for around 1/3 the price. The camera is good but not for professional phototagraphers. The display is a full hd ips display and can be very birght. The phone is made of plastic but it has a nice brushed finish which makes it look premium. The Duel Front facing speakers are loud and clear. Now the reason I gave this product a 4 star is the performances and experiences I had recently. The double tap feature is sometimes laggy and sometimes I have to double tap multiple times to get the phone open. When I go on a heavy website on the web browser, I can barely scroll the screen. We will see an update for this phone however, and hopefully these issues will be resolved. In conclusion get this phone and stop thinking about those high end smartphones. p
I have never been as disappointed with an item from Amazon as I am with this one.First, some good points about the phone. The display and audio are top notch. Not even by grading on the curve of a $250 phone, they were as good or better than just about any flagship I've had. As good or better than any other display I've seen, and the front facing stereo speakers were amazing. No question about it. The phone performed fairly well, just a little bit slower than my 2013 LG Optimus G Pro, which had the same basic specs as this unit. The almost stock Android Lollipop was a nice thing to have, not much bloatware had to be removed. I changed the phone's supplied launcher to the Google Launcher and that gave the unit even more of a stock Android feel.I should have known I was in for a nightmare when I opened the phone and found that Alcatel didn't include the tool that's needed to pop out the SIM and SD card tray. It took a couple of hours to find something small enough to fit into the tiny hole that releases the tray, and since the phone arrived on a Saturday, Alcatel tech support was closed and Amazon was no help, offering to send a replacement phone that might arrive Monday, but most likely would come Tuesday. Glad I pay for Amazon Prime to get such speedy service when a product is defective. But I finally got the tray open and was able to insert the SIM and SD cards from my current phone. Turned the phone on and it immediately found AT&T, provisioned itself smoothly, and I thought I was off to the races. Boy, was I wrong.I spent almost two days migrating apps from my old phone to this one, arranging the icons on the screen where I wanted them (this phone only allowed 4 icons in a row while the LG had 5, so the NFC setup process couldn't replicate my current screen arrangement) and re-entering login and other information for all my apps. I have a fair amount of apps, so it took a while. In order to clean the cache and speed up the phone a bit after everything was "just so", I restarted the phone, something I've done with the ten or so other Android phones I've had over the years. When the phone came back up, I noticed that about a third of the app icons were gone from my home screens. Just gone. And when I tried to open a couple of other apps, I got a message on the bottom of the screen that the app wasn't installed.I know Android can do some funky things, so I waited about ten minutes to see if the information would show up on the screen and it hadn't changed, so I rebooted the phone again. When it came on, even MORE icons were missing from the home screens. I could find most (not all) of the missing apps in the app drawer and could launch about half of them. But some of the data was gone, with very little chance of getting it back. And since I lost more data the second time I restarted the phone, I wasn't really interested in restarting again and losing even more data.So the two days I spent getting the phone loaded up were blown the second I tried to restart it. I hardly call that a small bug, and looking around some developer forums, it doesn't seem to be a bug tied to Android 5.0.2, which is what the phone is running with an Alcatel layer over it. So it's either the Alcatel modifications or a hardware issue causing the problem. Either way, that kind of performance is completely unacceptable, and while I think the phone has some good parts to it and the price is right, if it's going to lose data, I can't trust it or continue to use it. Even my kid's $99 BLU phone is more stable than this device is.So back to Amazon it goes, along with the accessories that were supposed to arrive on Sunday but didn't come because Amazon made a deal with the Devil when they chose the USPS to handle its Sunday deliveries. All in all, about a $300 lesson that sometimes you get what you pay for, and in this case I got a useless, low quality phone on the inside that looks like a great phone on the outside.Oh, and one more thing. Amazon chose to ship the phone via USPS in a padded envelope, not a box. I found the envelope with the phone in it jammed in my mailbox with all my other mail, making for a very tight squeeze to get the envelope out of the mailbox without tearing it. So the phone had less protection than it probably should have had and went through the postal system, which could have led to some kind of a hardware defect. I'm not going to try my luck with another phone, especially if Amazon is going to use such an insecure way to ship the phone. I bet they don't ship S6's in envelopes. Just sayin'.Next time, I'll spend a little more money and get a phone I can trust. n
Outstanding value. Very good recption on H2O network (AT&T MVNO). Screen is just brilliant . . . easy to read in direct sunlight at Noon in San Antonio, Texas. Sound is sharp and clear through front facing speakers. Great battery life. Reverseability works as advertised & is very handy. Being as this is from a second tier manufacturer I did not expect stellar quality or support. I was wrong. I got an OTA software update yesterday (7/13/2025) that was an unexpected surprise. Double tap to wake is now rock solid. Android software is nearly stock and any bloatware is easily removed, unlike other manufacturers I could mention (Samsung,LG, etc.). This phone replaced a Nexus 5 and IMHO is superior in every way. p
The Idol 3 has been provided an amazing experience for me at a third of the cost of some of the top-tier phones available on the market. At $250 this smartphone provides all of the functionality I would want from a daily driver and there are only a few nit-picky features (a better camera, ir blaster, wireless charging and dedicated shutter button) missing that I would need to have to "upgrade" away from this phone. The previous phones I have used in order are the Galaxy Note II, Moto X, and the Sharp Aquos Crystal and this phone blows them all out the water.Design and Size:Simply put, this phone feels great in the hand. The symmetrical design and lack of capacitive keys really make the phone seem much smaller than other phones of the same screen size. At 5.5" this phone is relatively easy to use one-handed (and I have average to small-sized hands for a guy). It is also as light or lighter than my previous phones. It does not have "premium build quality" with metals or glass, but personally that has never mattered to me. Besides the customization of designing my Moto X nothing really stood out as "me" when looking to purchase other phones. But besides all that, the phone looks great. The brushed metal look works for me, and since it is plastic it works for my wallet as well. I have never had an issue with dropping this phone or it feeling awkward to use.Screen:This screen is great. It is 1080p, videos play well, colors pop, and I can take it out in the middle of the day and actually see the screen in direct sunlight. The size of the screen also makes reading text easier and videos feel immersive. It doesn't quite live up to the borderless Aquos Crystal experience, but there is no light leakage on this screen and it does better at an angle. Also, the screen responds well to the touch, even with a tempered-glass protective covering over it. That is something that cannot be said with the Sharp Aquos Crystal.Sound:I never realized how much having the front-facing speakers would improve the quality of gaming and video experiences. Being able to lay down the phone and watch a video without the output sounding muffled or indistiguishable from gibberish is awesome. I find myself watching videos on my phone more than ever because of the audio features. Additionally, the included JBL earbuds are a nice touch and the JBL Mix audio app is one of the coolest I have ever used. I honestly find myself making playlists just to work on my mixing and transitions between tracks. Just check out some videos on youtube to see the app for itself because honestly a description here won't do justice to how fun the app is.Operating System and features:Comes out of the box with lollipop and just updated to version 5.0.2 today. As with any android phone customization is really limitless so I won't spend time on that here. The reversible feature is pretty neat, and merits me echoing other reviews. If it was not for the button placement or the design of my screen protector there would be times when I pull my phone out of my pocket and have no idea it was upside-down. The fluidity with how it works really stands out for functionality, and I am suprized this has not been a feature in phones prior to the Idol 3.Battery Life:There are phones that will get you longer battery life, but I have never been able to kill my phone in just one day of daily use. I am not implying that it will be at 30% when you wake up the next day, but it is definitely an upgrade over my first gen Moto X. Not having to find a charger immediately when I get home from work provides a little more freedom to the daily grind. I know that usage varies by person, but outside of gamers I don't think moderate to light users will have too many gripes about battery life.Conclusion:Buy this phone. If you want a great experience at a great price, buy this phone. One of my best decisions in a while to take the plunge. Being an unlocked phone carrying no carrier bloatware and built in apps like Mix, File Explorer and Wifi Display actually adding to the experience, Im starting to see less and less reason to ever sign up for a carrier contract again. If you need financing options, there is an Amazon store card for that. At $250 though, you won't find yourself in much of a financial bind if you decide to pick one up. p
Nice phone, so far !!! p
Honestly, I love this phone. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse. Although it was used. It preforms well but my package didn't come with the jbl headphone, just apple headphones. As for most users, battery is a main concern. My idol 3 gets about four to five hours of screen one time. I would like to state I am a heavy battery user. Bluetooth enabled most of time for my moto 360 and Bluetooth devices. Data also enabled for couple hours. For my opinion, this is an average phone, battery wise. Buy a fast charger for this phone as it only comes with a standard alcatel charger. The NFC and the Gyroscope sensor work very well for VR streaming. On board speakers are greatly better than most phones due to the dual front facing features. The camera is just good. Nothing to write home about. I highly advise y'all to buy the "A better camera unlocked" app. There is also a free version if y'all are into that. The app will make the camera in par with the iPhone cameras. If y'all are wondering about the double tap to wake feature. I'd like to say it works but only with the one touch launcher. It might just be a software issue with the marshmallow upfate. Hope alcatel fixes it soon. As of now. I use nova launcher with the knock lock app and the gravity lock app. Works well in unison.Overall. Great phone for the $200 mark. I did get mine used and for cheaper the price. Nothing bad. Hope this review helped your decision to consider this phone. Thanks bye bye p
High quality & features at a low cost. Love it! p
Got updated to Marshmallow on 6/15!!! p
Great for the price or any price you can think of. p
Had to return, wouldn't maintain quality signal in my area. To bad because I saw the potential and the sound quality on wi-fi was fantastic! p
Great Phone. Reliable. Fast. All you expect the reviews it to be until... the phone reaches 0%. I Tried recharging the phone for more then 3-4 hours and won't hold a charge. I would hold the power button for more then 20 seconds and no response, just the led light. I looked up the issue and it could be one of two problems. The firmware might be setting the phone to hibernation or there might be a loose connection with the power button and socket. I didn't want to void my warranty so I replaced the phone through amazon.I waited another 4 days for a new phone and the phone seemed fine, but the led light would constantly flash even when all apps and notifications were turned off. I let the phone go down to 0% again at work and tested if the phone would be able to turn back on again. I charged it for 5-6 hours this time and no responsive. The led light would turn on when charging and that would be it. I don't know if its my bad luck but i will be replacing it one last time. If it is true then the phone is only good to hold one charge! Don't let it drain out completely or it won't turn on. n
This is the second ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3. Set it up and shut it off and you'll not be able to use the device again! Going the Wallmart tomorrow and if the Sim Card does'nt fix it, it's going back the amazon! One star because no lower option. n
I really wanted to like this phone. I looked up the specs, read the reviews and searched online for the best phone for my money. I decided this was the phone to get, everyone raved about it. They said it was the best phone under $300, blah blah you've probably seen all that too. Lets start with the good. It has a pretty decent camera and a nice big screen... that's about it. I consider myself to be a simple man, if I buy something, its because it's supposed to serve a purpose. This phone froze all of the time, not only did I experience the stutter others experienced, but it froze and it crashed often. At first I thought it was my fault, so I cleared all of my cache, deleted useless folders, downloaded cleaner apps etc. but nothing worked, the phone kept freezing, crashing, and rebooting itself when I was in the middle of things. I've had this phone about two weeks now and I've had it. In a rage, I twisted the phone in my hands until I had shattered the LCD, screen and mangled the housing. It felt awesome. All in all, I should have known better this phone was released in 2014 and we're living in 2016. Two years in the tech industry is a lifetime... don't make the mistake I made. If you hate freezing, unresponsive, garbage cell phones, DON'T buy this product. n
1 year into having the Idol 3 5.5...I wish I would've bought a Moto X Pure. When it works, it works fine. I've had to do a couple factory resets, I've had to send it off to be repaired when the screen popped off the body, and now it won't stay locked on a cell or data signal, so it's back into the repair shop. Again. Spend the extra money and get something more reliable. n
love it can't wait for the Idol 4 p
Much better than I thought. Nice phone!. p
Great phone. Mom loves it as a replacement for her Moto G. Love the stock version of Android -- it's super fast and smooth and the screen is perfect in quality and size for her. p
i love it p
This phone is absolutely excellent. I have had it over a month now and it receives excellent coverage for T-Mobile on the Dallas and Austin Texas areas. The phone is very light and feels very nice to hold. The speakers are excellent and the headphones sound amazing but I have trouble keeping them in my ears even after changing the earbud inserts. Phone streams MLB.TV on the LTE network with no issues which was one of the main things I was hoping for. Battery life is excellent, I am not a hardcore phone user but it lasts me 2 days without charging which includes the mlb app, clash of clans, and facebook/google hangouts messaging. If you are looking for a new phone and not wanting to spend a fortune this phone is perfect choice. I have had no latency issues with the 5.0 Android build with it like I read. The screen is very vibrant and looks amazing.Cons: Like to pocket dial a lot but I heard Android is famous for that with emergency calling. No Camera button on the sides, I was very accustomed to it on my Nokia Lumia 925. Only 2 pages for shortcuts to apps, not sure if that is able to be changed or not. The double tap screen isn't as responsive as my wife's Sony Xperia. But I can live with those cons.I am not an Android fan boy and this is my first Android phone I converted from a Windows phone (Which I also loved.) I have to say all in all I would highly recommend this phone. p
It's hard to believe that such a good phone is available at this price. I was using a Note 2 and fell in love with the large screen size. I love the SD slot, which is why I won't get a new Note, Samsung has lost me. The front facing speakers are great, I wish every mobile device had this. The screen is vibrant. It is fairly close to a stock Android experience. I like the camera, I have no problem using this instead of my "real" camera in most cases. Being unlocked is a must for me now.I would definitely recommend this phone. I see no reason to pay the flagship prices when a phone like this can do everything I need, I would not consider myself a "power user" though. p
I've had this phone for about 2 months and really have had no problems with it. I admit that I am a fairly light user, and mainly use it as a phone. I can go at least 4-5 days between charges, honestly up to a week....Reception is better than my previous phones (Samsung & Sony phones) and wifi strength is comparable. There had been some camera issues (the main one for me being battery drain) but that's been improved. The "tap to turn on" feature works reliably now, the screen is beautiful, and it's fast with web and google play store browsing.The button locations may be a problem for some, but I find I use it upside down just as much as right side up. Since always use my phone left handed because I am doing something else (like writing or unlocking a door) with my dominant hand, it's nice to have those buttons where they are.... My hands are pretty small but dexterous so a little "shimmy" is not a problem given my case.I have only dropped it once-- it has no chips or scratches.Could not be more pleased at this point, but I don't think that my use is typical. However it TOTALLY works for me... NOW (good updates). p
This is a great phone. I'm not sure why they call this a mid range phone when the specs are the same/if better than the Galaxy line, M8 from HTC, etc. p
The phone is very decent for its price. But as with cheap products, there is always a downfall.1. The phone has gotten visibly slower than when it came. It has been only around two months and already its speed has decreased by a certain amount.2. This issue is the more disappointing one: The back squeaks and clicks when you press against it. This probably means that the back cover has gotten loose somehow. I have never dropped the phone, nor do I use it roughly. I am very gentle with it, and only after 1 month of use (the other month was spent on a trip), the back is already loose. I am very disappointed and the return period is already over.I was very hopeful for this smartphone, but it seems that there is a reason why higher end phones are priced the way they are. n
Possibly the best all around budget smartphone. I love this phone but its removable battery and large body size isnt for everyone. I like this phone for everything it has. p
For the prize its wonderfull p
I personally can't imagine needing to anything beyond this phone's capabilities. It handles everything I ask of it; combinations of texting, phone calls, Youtube, GPS, streaming video and audio services. I've read that the phone can bog down when you multitask too much with it, but I haven't noticed this with my usage. I use this phone which Cricket Wireless (which I would also recommend).Pros:-Screen is great (in brightness and picture quality).-Battery lasts the day unless I do really push it.-Speakers are crisp and decently loud.-The phone is responsive in processing tasks.-The rear camera takes decent pictures under any conditions I've tried.-The cost.Cons-Call quality could be a little better (this may be Cricket's fault) but the quality is good enough to not be an issue.-I wish the speakers were louder; I can't hear audio if I leave the phone on outside of the shower. I realize this is a pretty needy desire that I have.-The stock texting app is pretty terrible. I didn't use it long because one of its "features" is to set the date of all group texts to someday in 1970 which causes the message to auto sort to the bottom of the inbox list. Fortunately the Google Messaging app is free and a good replacement.-Bloatware. There isn't a ton of it relative to other phones but it still drives me crazy that I can't delete apps such as the aforementioned terrible texting app.-The screen seems overly sensitive (i.e. often selecting links as I try to scroll through a webpage). However, this may be due to my screen protector. However, I do find it very easy to click small links or buttons accurately.-The front camera isn't the best, but selfies are for nerds.Overall, I can't recommend this phone enough. I can't see a reason to spend more on a different phone. Most of my complaints were easily resolved or not that problematic. I will absolutely look at whatever the latest Alcatel offering is in a few years when it is time for a new phone. p
I love this phone so far. A few weeks ago my oneplus one had started to have some issues and I wasn't able to fix it... so I started looking for a new phone. I bought the moto x pure.... it was ok but for the price it wasn't as nice as my oneplus one and I also didn't like how flimsy the buttons were.. so I returned that and tried the blu life one XL which was supposed to be decent (I've had a blu phone in the past and liked it)... I tried it and it was sooo slow.. so that went back. After researching I was torn between the idol3 and the zenfone2... both have great reviews. I chose the idol because of the speakers on front and I'm glad I did. The phone feels great in the hand. Call quality so far is good even in my house and the speakers sound great. The screen is clear (I would suggest pushing the display brightness up a bit) and the reverse call feature is pretty cool. (You can set a feature to have the phone screen to rotate no matter how you are holding it) The only thing that I don't like is the power button is hard to reach and I have long fingers. p
I purchased my phone July 2015 it's a ok phone my review is not about the phone but there customer service. Be aware that when you purchase this phone that there customer service is horrible. Beginning of October I had issues with my Sd and Sims slot not reading. I contacted Alcatel concerning the problem and was told I would have to send my phone in to be repaired for 15 days. When I asked why so long and I quote their customer service person said " I sent you the email so do what you want". I complained on Twitter the Alcatel company contacted me about the problem saying they needed more information it's been a week still have not spoken to anyone or gotten help with this problem. Horrible customer service horrible phone. I guess you pay for what you get! ðŸ˜«ðŸ‘ŽðŸ½ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡. Final verdict all Alcatel could for me was offer me a free shipping label. If you purchase this product and it breaks you have to send it in to there repair center. They did not offer to replace the phone or even send a refurbish phone. Phone in the garbage like there company is garbage. I would not buy this phone. n
This is a very capable phone. The screen is quite good, and it handles most of my daily tasks without issue. I have found that the Outlook app occasionally slows down dramatically and is unusable, and requires the phone to be rebooted. But other than that, the battery life is adequate for a full day under moderate-to-heavy use, even when travelling, and I have encountered no red flags with this device. It's a pleasure to use and a good value for the money. p
This phone is absolutely amazing. I use it everyday and its funny because all my friends have the latest iphone... Well im not really a swing vote on Android vs Apple, but this phone In my opinion is equivalent to the Iphone 6, same size, same camera, same speed. Literally almost all the specifications are there except this one you can have a much bigger memory slot, since its changeable. And its 3x cheaper. I read multiple reviews on different phones, and This one is the best buy for its buck. the 4.7 inch screen is Okay, if you have the money go buy that one, but if you have the extra money, just buy this one. I also recommend a case for this, since without one its slick as ice in your hand. p
I have had it for 2 months now. It definitely is a great phone, but does have some shortfalls. The phone is well built and although made of plastic, does feel like a very good solid build - almost as solid as an Iphone, without the weight. Screen is good, although I tend to keep my brightness at 60% to get a comparable display to my iphone. The colors are not as luch as my iphone - a tad washed out but after a while you dont even notice. the sound of the external speakers is amazing! I love it. the sound of the phone with headphones/earphones, both good quality and the ones it came with it, is good - but very low - no matter what app i use to watch videos/hear music, i find it to be a little low for my taste. The vanilla OS is awesome, but after installing just a few apps and 2 months use, the phone now feels very sluggish and and slow.. I find myself constantly having to clean my ram etc. For the price point, its OK.. I think it should cost a little lower considering other phones out there in the under $200 range which easily outperform this device. my true love and reason for buying this phone is the thickness and feel of it... besides that, didnt fine much special about it. Also, my phone appeard to be a 're-pack' as the box was not sealed, and my headphones were defective. I called Alcatel support for an exchange on the headphones and they were very nice and said they will simply send me out a new pair. That was two months ago, i never got anything. I still have to call them again. sux i have to chase them down for something I purchased (supposedly) brand new. the 3 stars however are for the phone, and have nothing to do with the headphone/used phone experience. n
Screen capture button is horrible, same button as power on. Screen brightness is another issue. Hard to take pics while outdoors in sun shine. Good batteries, great camera, fast processor,awesome speakers for music... n
I really love the phone, Excellent screen, nice camera and great audio.The battery last the whole day. p
This is an amazing phone. Screen res., processing/multi-tasking power, and the camera is awesome too! But the coolest thing, is that it has dual speakers, dual mics so no matter how you grab it the screen and mic/speaker sync to how you hold the phone! No longer do you have to fiddle with your smartphone, feeling for buttons so you can make sure it's right-side-up. It always is thanks to the programming and speakers. It is loud and music and even headphone quality tops my old iphone 4s. Worth it. p
I ordered this phone after seeing the advertisements on tv and I love it!! I was in a desperate state after my previous phone was forced to update to Lollipop after several years of running flawlessly. Unfortunately, Lollipop did not agree with my phone and within an hour I had a nonfunctioning brick. The Alcatel ONETOUCH is by far the best phone I've had and really saved my bacon because my other option was a $600+ phone that I really couldn't afford. Yes, I will admit it takes some getting use to. It's touchy, so when searching on the internet you can accidentally open multiple pages when scrolling, within a few days I was able to figure out the sweet spot on the screen to get around this problem. The sound quality is good which is a problem I read other people had. Picture quality is awesome so far. I've only had the phone for a few months so it's not like I've been in many situations to test the camera's limits, but for day to day use it's pretty solid. When I took this phone to get a new SIM card the tech guy raved on and on about how great the specs are and how it's such a great deal. I can't really speak for that because I have no idea what the specs are in comparison to others. He fiddled with it for a few minutes and in that time 3 people who were trying to get new phones left to order this one. It really is the best deal out there. I was slightly worried about how it would respond to my network (t-mobile) but it runs perfectly. I have no complaints and have recommended it to everyone I know. In fact my mom and dad were due for an upgrade and I order these for them and they love them too. p
Great screen, great camera, great audio and great design. Even better with nova launcher after the update :) p
recommend p
Just too good for the money paid. Speakers are awesome and phone is very slim and lightweight with attractive design. p
GOOD SMART PHONE GOOD PRICE VERY GOOD SOUND p
Let me start by clarifying the title. While this device may not match up to the current flagships on the market, keep in mind that this is last year's model. Going from an LG G4 to this phone, the only noticeable downgrade was the camera and the non removable battery. That being said, the camera is still better than all of my older flagships except that one, and while the battery isn't replaceable, it still outlasts what my G4 would with the same usage. I sell phones for a living and as a bit of a phone enthusiast, I've used every major brand of phone either for personal use or I've set them up or performed troubleshooting for customers. Alcatel is a brand that I've seen very hit or miss devices come from, so I was a bit leary buying one. I have to say I don't regret it one bit. At the new price of $99 it's a no brainer. If you're looking for a phone that gets stuff done for under $200, this is it. The sound is fantastic, the processor is very snappy even though it's not the very top of the line snapdragon. The phone's design is brilliant and it looks and feels great. There is no real bloatware other than all of the Google apps, and the launcher is clean and very close to pure android. As with any phone, don't forget protection. It will last for you as long as you don't abuse it, and Alcatel does stand behind their warranty so if it does happen to malfunction they will fix it. This phone is what I've been waiting years for. You can't get a better phone at this price point. p
This is a really nice Android smartphone. There is a software update that brings Android 6.0.1. It's not a gaming smartphone, but for a day basics stuff it's perfect.The only downside is the lack of system languages. I live in America, I talk english, but will be nice to use the device in my native language. p
Love this phone and great piece of hardware p
The device was everything I wanted at a very low budget price. I couldn't believe it was real until I actually saw it.. amazing featured too p
Excellent quality for the value. Good product. Just buy together with a screen protector and you will be fine. p
Here it is fast and honest. Camera is low quality, not garbage but it's passable. Charges kind of slow too. The star here is audio, these front facing speakers are gold. The phone runs good with minimal lag. I love the way it looks. I intend to buy the newer version after using this little gem. I'd buy it again if it broke tomorrow. Such a beastly media consumption device! p
I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It's only the middle of May, 5 months after she got it, and the phone is already having charging problems, power on and off issues. She takes good care of her things and does not abuse them. We've both been very frustrated with it. We like the big screen, sound quality, and specs it promised, but the issues I mentioned are driving us away from ever trusting the Alcatel brand again. Not to mention, this is not the first Alcatel phone I own that I have issue with. I had dealt with the Alcatel Onetouch Fierce's sound quality going bad and touch screen not responding in the past after owning it for only about half a year. I thought I'd give them another try due to all the raving and good reviews. The Alcatel brand failed me once again. n
Had phone since November about 3 or 4 months using this phone the power button has become unresponsive and is not fully functional n
As described, arrived on time. Great features in the phone. Camera is very high quality. p
This phone worked great for 6 months. The battery life was phenomenal, the systems were all simple to use, no issues. Then, the nightmare began. At first, the battery would die once it hit 95%. I would have to put the phone back on the charger and wait for it to reboot up and charge back up to 100, then less than an hour later it would happen again. Eventually it stopped allowing me to do anything at all. Alcatel has no real support, save a call number that will not do anything for you. I tried replacing the battery, but same issue continued. I took it into a local repair shop and after three weeks they gave it back to me and refunded all charges, telling me that it must be a software issue, because the battery and charging ports work fine. However, because Alcatel doesn't have any real customer troubleshooting or service, I have no way to fix it. There is a reason people buy from trusted companies with well established reputations for troubleshooting and repairs. Save yourself the headache and get a Moto G or just sell your soul and get an IPhone. You shouldn't have to drop $250 on something that'll last less than six months. n
Excellent phone, but I dropped and broke it the same day it arrived. p
I am very happy with this new phone to'm fine now good only bad thing that the battery can not be changed but I'm happy with my new idol acatel 3 graces. p
Alcatel is slow on up dates, it appears they will not update to 5.1, setting the stage for a dead end phone. Does not support wifi calling. They have gone out of their way of preventing rooting, u can root, then your out of luck if u want to revert. They mess with partition lock. Okay phone, other then alcatel's anal approach to prevent custom o.s n
Hello! After around 6 full months of owning this phone, I'd like to share my 2 cents.I bought this back in October and I am an AT&T costumer. It was a simple process of transferring my SIM card form my previous (much older smartphone) to this new Alcatel Idol 3. I had bought a 64gb memory card to go along with it and again, the installation was super simple and really easy. Both the SIM and memory card sit side-by-side like buddies in a tray that pops in and out of the phone using a thin wire -- such as a paperclip.Anyway, down to the phone itself. I love it. It has met and exceeded my needs and I've used it A LOT in these six months. Like a lot a lot. Everyday for a few hours at least. I do everything from playing games on it, surfing the web, playing videos (lots of youtube!), playing music, reading articles, and of course, calling and texting -- because it's a phone.Here is what I absolutely LOVE about this phone:- The screen. Oh boy the screen. This thing has a beautiful, incredibly BRIGHT screen. I actually have it on the lowest brightness setting, because anything higher than that it is too bright haha. It's really a gorgeous screen. Full HD, 401ppi. Looks great. Again, can get VERY bright.- The RAM and processor. The combination of these two have met my needs with hardly any problems. I've had multiple, high-demanding apps running in the background (games, YouTube, Torrent clients) and the phone does well to keep up with what I throw at it. It does slow down eventually and can appear like it's struggling, but I can imagine that'd be the case with any device after meeting its threshold.- The speakers! I don't use them much, but man oh man when I do, they're a joy. This phone has excellent front facing speakers that really do fill a room. I use this phone for my alarm and every morning hearing this thing blast away some beautiful sounding tunes is a real treat to wake up to.- Build quality. This is not only a nice-looking phone, but if feels well built and constructed. Quite a bit nicer than the price-tag would hint at. I was, and am, thoroughly impressed with it. I've managed to take good care of it, so there's no noticeable scratches on both the backside and the screen. And none have randomly appeared.- The battery! Oh jeez. So when I say that I use this phone A LOT. I sure mean it, and this battery holds up REALLY well. On the way to work, at work, and upon arriving back at home I am usually left with a good chunk of battery life -- 30-40%. It very rarely dips below 20% on a given day, which is freakin' awesome.Things I like about it, but could be better:- It's thin and lightweight. I was super surprised by how thin and light it was and actually very nervous about handling it. However, upon buying and putting on a decent size case which added a little bulk to it, the phone size is just about perfect. But I wouldn't mind it being a bit heavier and maybe a touch thicker, just so if I did end up dropping it I wouldn't feel like it would explode.- The Camera. This takes a bit of trial and error, such as finding an appropriate app that will utilize the camera to it's fullest. The camera is not "oh wow! Look at that!" great when I first used it. I had to get accustomed to where and how it worked best. For example, it's not great in low-light environments. Taking a picture at night? Uh, forget about it. It's rough times. But in daytime, with lots going on and lots of things to focus on, the camera does surprisingly well and can -- on occasion -- take some truly spectacular pictures. But those times are few and far between. So I'd recommend finding a different phone if you really want a nice camera on a phone, BUT for the most part this guy does the trick -- just be a bit prepared for figuring out its limitations. Also, the front-facing "selfie" camera is surprisingly nice! The few selfies I've taken have turned out better than I'd like to admit!- The pre-installed launcher. Eh, it's not great, but it's not terrible. It can get sluggish and doesn't look the best. There are other options out there that are far better. Also, many of the pre-installed apps sort of fall into the same boat. They're not great, but they're not terrible. I really wish the file managed was better though, because it seems to be the only app that you can voluntarily copy and move files between the internal storage and the micro sd card. Ugh, I think that might be an android issue though...- Sound quality, internal audio amp/driver. Now, I ain't no audiophile or anything like that, but I do appreciate a nice sounding device paired with a nice set of earphones. This phone, similar to its camera, gets the job done, but again there isn't that "wow! Listen to this!" feeling. I wasn't buying the phone for its audio capabilities -- internal audio driver -- but with it's awesome external speakers and its partnership (somewhat) with JBL I have to say that I was expecting more. I've used a number of apps with different audio files, but I've owned past devices that have sounded significantly better. Anyway, it's no deal-breaker, but it is a thing and if you're looking for a device with great sound quality, I'd look elsewhere.Overall, I am super happy with this phone. I bought it back when it was $250, and I am shocked it has dropped down to $200. It's a steal at that price. It really is. It's no flagship, IPhone destroyer, but it gets the job done with battery to spare! I really do like it and I think if you're an AT&T costumer looking for a new smartphone for a smart price, then this is it. Everything I've asked it to do -- both usual and ugh...unusual hahah -- it has executed well.If you do end up getting it, here are a few parting recommendations:- purchase a 64gb micro sd card. They're cheap, awesome, and easy to install- Get a case! It makes the phone a bit bigger and easier to handle. I don't like screen protectors, so I can't speak about those.- Look into finding a camera app for the phone. I bought one on Google PlayStore called Cameringo+Effects and I really like it. Just make sure to set it to HD pictures. It'll seem like it has a smaller viewing screen, but the quality of the photos are a TON better than the default picture quality on the app.- Look into finding a different launcher for the phone. I got Nova Launcher Prime and it makes the phone's interface speedier and more user-friendly, and you can customize it off the wazoo.Alright, well that's my 2 cents on this phone. Overall, I think it's great and at $200, it's quite the stealio. p
So far I really like my phone. Larger than I was thinking it would be, but getting used to that! I need a purse with a bigger phone pocket! p
I have had this phone almost one year in about two weeks. I wrote a review on Alcatel's website. To my dismay when I checked back on the review I wrote and how may stars I gave it, had been altered. The stars had been bump up from two to four stars and what I wrote edited by shortening the bad part of the review. I was absolutely disgusted. The phone itself is not bad for the price but the customer service is not good at all. I have heard similar complaints. And the complaints stem from questions to do with updates to the phone. The phone came with Lollipop 5.0. They do not respond when asked by customers regarding updates to the phone. Not on their website, Facebook or speaking to them. Speak to them on updates and they have no answer for you. Because of that I will never buy this phone again. n
Excellent phone for the price. I went to this from the LG Nexus 5, and I'm pretty sure the Idol 3 outperforms it on every level. Very satisfied with this phone. p
Synopsis:I like it. it's not blowing me away, but for the price I knew it couldn't be perfect. I had to return one due to issues caused by an OTA system update, and the second one has a crackly headphone port, but otherwise it's been great. A fantastic alternative to the "deals" offered by the major carriers (I'm lookin at you, AT&T Next)The Phone: The Bad:Really just 1 thing: The headphone port is a little crackly. by that I mean if you plug in headphones, and nudge the the jack, the sound crackles, and you may lose audio in one ear until it sorts itself out. I know this may be a MUCH bigger issue for some people, but I've had devices with crackly headphone ports for years without failing, and really, I am rarely on the move with headphones on, and if I am, I'll be careful to make sure the jack isn't being jostled. I could return the phone again, but I'd have to take another refund and repurchase, and I'm not willing to have $600 tied up in pending Amazon refunds.The Good:Size:I was worried about the size initially. My old phone is a Galaxy 2 Skyrocket. It has a 4" screen. I thought it was perfect. This took literally no time to get comfortable with. Yes, one hand operation is mostly gone, but it turns out that I don't even notice. It fits in pockets nicely and textured just enough to not be too slick.Screen:I'm no connoisseur of screens, but this thing seems excellent. In a dark room I actually wish it would dim a little more. No problems in full summer sun. colours, saturation and depth are great to my eyes.speakers:surprisingly good. Whatever they did with JBL worked. Similarly for the headphones. Far superior to any headphones I've ever gotten with a phone or music device.Reception:On par with my Samsung and my wife's Nokia Lumia. really like the notification for when I'm on LTE, H+, etc.Wifi:Like a few other devices ( XBox1), it doesn't seem to play well with my Comcast Xfinity home Wifi. Other places it's fine. That's a comcast issue.Camera:meh. it's got a lot of pixels and nice features, but images seem to be noisy when the lighting isnt perfect. My old Samsung was better. Supposedly better after the OTA update.Performance:smooth, fast. Gets a little hot with graphically intense games, but that's normal. Just a hair of lag when downloading/installing multiple apps. Nothing to fret over.UI:Less is more. It's simple, and seems just lightly massaged. preloaded apps are mostly what you'd want anyway.Battery:better than my old Samsung, I don't have a lot to put here. it holds up well to moderate use throughout the day. p
This phone is probably the best for the price. It has a really bright screen, it's thin, has an sd card slot, fast processor, and front facing speakers. And it has nfc, which the new moto g, oneplus 2, and huawei p8 lite don't have. It's also going to be updated to get protected from the "Stagefright" bug soon. Nice to see a company caring about users.However....While this phone was in a bag it got cracked. There was a case on it but it still got cracked. The digitizer did not work so I shipped it to alcatel for repair and it is costing me $100 for them to fix it.So please buy a tempered glass screen, and don't put any pressure on the phone. I even noticed that if you press hard enough you will see spots, I guess from the lcd.If you are looking for a phone that doesn't crack easy and is similar price I recommend the OnePlus One. I've hade it with a small orzly fusion case and it isn't cracked. It does have a tempered glass on it but that's only been recently. n
Not thrilled about tool to open ,but it's a good phone p
After using the phone as my daily driver for a month I can honestly say this is one of the best experiences you can have off a budget smart phone. I use the term budget for the description of the price range however the experience is that of a flagship phone. In this review I will talk about the design, hardware, usability, and daily experience of the phone.DesignIts not secret that at this price range you are going to get a plastic phone. With that aside its one of the nicest builds. It have a solid but light feel in the hand. The back is make of a matte metallic sheen that is pleasant to the touch and is not slick and will not attract finger prints. Another note is that the back of the phone is completely flat including the camera does not protrude from the body of the phone. Their is a nice chrome lip all the way around the edge front and back that breaks up the black and gray quite tastefully. Lastly the phone is completely symmetrical. The top and bottom are completely identical with the exception of the excellent front camera and photo-sensor and there is a reason for it. I'll explain more in the experience section.HardwareDespite the price this prince is running a Snapdragon 615 octa-core with 4 cores at 1.5ghz and the other 4 at 1.0ghz and 2GB of ram. It has wifi with 5ghz band and 2.4ghz support. I can say that the wifi works well and has great range (helps if you have a good router as well). LTE is band 12 capable for those who will be using T-Mobile. The rear facing camera is a 13 megapixel Sony sensor with a 8 megapixel front facing camera but shoot at 4:3 aspect ratio. If you want 16:9 HD photos the sensor will go bring the pixel count down to 9.4 mega pixel and 5.1 on the front camera. The display is a bright and beautiful 5.5 inch IPS HD display running at 1920x1080P with 401 pixels per inch. And to tight everything together are JBL powered stereo speakers with 2 microphones one on top and bottom of the phone. All that powered by a 2915mah battery.UsabilityI had a Motorola X (2013) which made usability far better than any phone with its gestures and touchless command prompts beyond what OK Google can do. After having that experience its hard for any phone to compete with that. Going from a 4.7 inch display to a 5.5 inch was quite a jump however thanks to the minimal bezels its make it easy to use. I have small hands and reaching across the screen to the left and the top was a little hard put its still possible. The stereo speakers make it a harder because of the extra bezel it creates still nothing compared to the LG G3 or I phone 6 plus for that matter. The phone is very thin and light making completely unnoticeable in my pocket compared to the weight and thickness of my Moto X. Having the big and bright display with stereo speakers made every media experience amazing. The sound was rich and crystal clear, with good highs and mids, low lows but still better than any other phone out there. The photo-sensor works really well with its software. The screen always had the right amount of brightness, never to much indoors in the dark and you can see the display clearly in direct sunlight not problem. The front facing camera is just a dream with selfies (not that I do much) but video chatting and conferencing is just amazing. Google hangouts is a power app and the phone handles it not problem streaming HD and close to 30fps on a good internet connection. The display also runs at 60fps and drops a bit when moving around but its not even noticeable unless you are watching a fps monitoring software.ExperienceThe as a whole runs pretty smooth about 90% of the time. There are delays in opening apps in comparison to the top flagship phones but its only .5 sec behind in opening apps compared to the galaxy S6 or i Phone 6 plus. Once the app is open or in the ram it responds instantly with no lag. The home screen, multi-task bar, and quick setting menu from the top are lag free. Honestly its runs almost as well as any flagship to the point where you question why you are paying $700+ for a phone. The delay is never frustration or interfering with your task but its noticeable compared to the top flagships. I actually found myself preferring my phone speakers over my Bluetooth speakers because of the clarity was far superior. The phone is running a stock 5.0 android experience with an icon pack install with the Acatel launcher. I actually just installed the google now launcher for a more complete stock look. Not a fan of the bright looking icons on the Acatel launcher. The camera is a pretty awesome however the stock camera app is a flop. The image processing is horrible. I installed the google camera app and it did a much better job with the camera and image processing plus it gives you the ability to change aspect ratio and megapixel options. After all this the batter is a big plus. Its a true all day battery with normal usage and even powers users can get a good amount of usage before needing to charge. I was able to get 6.2 Hrs of on screen time watching Netflix through wifi. When power using during the day I got 4-5 hrs of on screen time. Over all if you want a flagship phone without the flagship price brand new, this is it. There is nothing that compares with it. p
I've only had this phone for 48 hours. It took less than 24 (including sleep) to have it set up with my favorite stuff. I continually use bluetooth and I'm REALLY active on my phone. Multiple email accounts and multiple active social media accounts. I can still get a full business day, plus some, on a single charge. Despite also still spending lots of time tweaking.It's said the camera may not be up to those of the flagship phones. I haven't tried the camera, yet, to verify that. But keep in mind that the flagships sell between $500-800+ and the Idol 3 is $250. One would expect a difference. Likewise, with the software. Some things have a perceptible difference in opening speed, but not enough to call them slow. And accessories are limited.In contrast, connections are stronger and faster than any previous device I've owned. I happen to live in an area where signal is weak and maybe a little flakey. There are hills and lots of brick homes blocking the two closest towers. Both cell and wifi are faster and cell strength is better. And it handles a 128 gig microsd card.The Idol 3 isn't a flagship killer. But, at the price, one would expect "good enough". And it's much closer to flagship than "good enough". If you need the fastest and the best, get a flagship. If you want a smartphone that can stand on its own merits, but allows you to spend your money on more important things, this is what you want. p
This phone is awesome. Best battery life on any phone I've ever used and I've used alot of them. The battery tends to last me 3 days with light use and 2 with heavy. The cameras are both pretty impressive for the price, the processor handles every game I play without any hiccups but it does come off a little sluggish outside of the games. Aside from the icons, this phone is basically pure android. I've thoroughly enjoyed it, its the best electronic device I've ever paid 250 for but if you are pure android lover and a power user, you'll enjoy this as a back up to a nexus. p
Great quality, great sound, and pure android Lollipop experience. I love the design and runs smother than my Samsung Galaxy S5, at half the price. Recommend to all android users if they want a great product. p
I received my phone on yesterday and must first say I appreciate all the previous reviews that guided me to this purchase. I did some research on this phone including YouTube videos that compared this phone to other budget phones and flagships. This phone has met all of my expectations and then some! I saw remarks about the double tap not being consistent. I actually figured that out. If you do a slower tap it usually works every time. Maybe a quick could "1,2" works just about every time. The battery seems good so far. The display is outstanding. I downloaded open camera after a reviewer suggested which is good. My 2 most recent phones were the LG g4 and galaxy s6. The s6 is certainly a great piece of equipment but I realized many of the features they offer I don't need and the price is just too much. I definitely recommend this device over any other android on the market. Even some iPhone users might like this as a temporary, secondary or converter back to the android platform. p
This is a great android phone at a nice price. I love mine. p
I've had this phone for five days. I love it! The screen is crisp and clear. The sound is unbelievable! It's very thin and easy to manage. You can't go wrong buying this amazing phone. Hubby convinced me to choose this one and I'm glad he did! p
This is a review after one week of usage. As a baseline for the review, I am not a power user. I only use it for phone calls, texting, checking email, and surfing when I'm not near a computer. For these purposes and needs, this phone is great (so far):- Phone is thin and light. Slim case serves my needs because does not add bulk but still adds protection- Phone looks visually nice (compared to direct competitors like the Zenfone and One Plus)- Screen is big and bright- Sound is way better with two front facing speakers- Battery life lasts the whole day with some to spare- Camera is good (enough). Good for impromptu moments. Don't have high expectations and you will be very pleased with the resultsLag is relative. I don't mind a delay of a nano-second to see what I need or do what I want to do. Overall, I am happy (so far) of the purchase of this phone. It fits my needs perfectly with the price point, features, and aesthetics. I think the Idol 3 is worth more than the $250 retail price. The only difficult part is telling people what phone I have. Alcatel is not a household name, nor is it easy to pronounce. A lot of people ask me about the phone and telling them about Alcatel is the biggest hang up for me. However, I was with T-Mobile when they first started. I was also with Samsung from the beginning. Hopefully I'll hit again with Alcatel. p
I love this smartphone is an excellent device. p
The best phone in this price range p
Love this phone, it's different then the other phone I had but all in all it's great. p
Sweet phone, great volume but had Wii issues. p
Realy gooooddd p
Amazing phone thats lightweight, thin, comfortable, and has a beautiful display, loud front facing speakers, fast processor, and nice premium desing. It foes get a little hot, but if you throw a case on it its fine. Also, the packaging is really nice. The included jbl headphones are really good p
Pros:* Price is tough to beat!* Very snappy - no speed issues.* Battery life is solid. With light use I regularly have about 55% battery left when I go to bed. I've not had it die on me yet.* SD card slot.* Not worrying about what side is up when you answer a call.* Very loud speakers with pretty high quality sound.Cons:* Camera is just okay. Works better in good lighting.* Can get a little warm when doing heavy processing.There aren't many cases for this phone it seems. In fact I ordered the window case and tempered glass with the phone when it was released, and neither actually shipped! (I got my money back of course.) The LK Ultra Slim case works pretty well and doesn't make it feel too thick.I switched from Verizon to AT&T prepaid with this phone.I would definitely recommend it! p
Have had the phone for 2 weeks and love it. Went from a Note 4 and IPhone 4s and don't miss them at all (OK, maybe the S Pen a bit). Screen is outstanding and performance is very good. Friends could not believe it's a $250 phone. Very light, so I do recommend a case. Using Straight Talk for a carrier and only complaint is a dropped cell signal occasionally. Still would purchase again. p
Large display and thin and light body. p
The big screen is nice, but the phone itself is so slow and sometimes shuts itself down which is really annoying. I also hate that the button to turn the screen on is on the left and the volume on the right. It's backwards from every other phone I've ever had. n
Bought this for my mom for christmas she said she likes it. I guess if your looking for a good cheap phone then buy this phone. p
Swag p
I've had this for a few months now and love it. Would not have chosen another phone. p
Outstanding phone love the speed, screen, and speakers. Thin light big screen but I can still use it one handed.Screen is better than my last phone a high end Nokia with oled. Calls clear, haptic feedback on screen taps makes typing a breeze. EQ on speakers and headphones. p
I preordered this found to use with my Ting service and I was loving it. Its a beautiful phone and I constantly had people asking me about it. However, mine seems to get hot very quickly watching videos and recently the battery expanded and has caused the phone to bend. It still works fine and battery life doesn't seem to have suffered but its very annoying ascetically. On top of that the ear buds that come with it already died on one side. I'd had this about 6 months, its disappointing for a phone I was so excited about and recommending to other until now. n
Piece of crap, broke within 3 months with minimal ware. Customer service is terrible and no parts are available for the device.I wasted 200 bucks and i'm never buying anything from Alcatel again. n
Received on time as promised in perfect condition. Set build quality and performance can not be beat at twice twice the price. Dual front facing speakers are great! Streaming videos flow smoothly along with web access. Email set up and contacts worked flawlessly. Battery life is good to excellent. My usage net a day and a half to two days before needing to recharge. On occasion have gotten into middle of third day. Unit out the box had Display set at about 60%. This looks great but I find that about 25% works for me.Should have purchased this set months ago.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty) p
i love this phone. much better than other expensive brands full hd display, fast processor, hifi speakers jbl. and price is very sweet, i am ordering second phone alcatel, and suggest to you choose 5.5 inch, because it is full hd 1920x1080,instead 4.7inch which is 1280x720. between two models price difference is only 50$ but features are much more than 50$ p
Good phone. Speaker is made for R&B Though. Metalheads beware p
Wow just WOW p
I purchased this after reading great reviews and I couldn't be more satisfied for the price. This phone's sound is unbelievable, and the screen is every bit as good as my Galaxy S4. Very lightweight for the large size. Love that I can add/change memory card via a pop-out tray on the side. One potential drawback for heavy phone users is nonremovable batter, but great for average phone use, music, podcasts and video. Good camera with plenty of options, too. Unlike some lower-priced phones, has latest version of Lollipop. p
The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it). p
Awesome phone! Beats out a lot of the bigger brand names at an awesome price p
Super, super phone for the price. Well constructed, lightweight but sturdy. p
Best budget phone ever. Has great display that pops, great signal and speed once I got 57 Mbps per second on T-Mobile but that also depends on coverage and where you live. I love it features sometimes I feel like I'm using a Nexus. No Andriod 5.1.1 yet but who cares you're getting a lot for your money! Sometimes I forget this is not a flagship. The camera is OK but honestly I think a software update will fix it since it's the same sensor in the one plus one. So if you have $250 get this phone!!!!! p
I've been using Amazon for almost a decade now. My household spends hundreds if not thousands on amazon purchases annually. I'm not a product review sort of guy. I typically just read through everyone else's comments to determine if a product is worthy or not. Amazon reviews have rarely steered me wrong. In this case I must make an exception and share my experience with the Alcatel one touch idol 3. I love everything about the phone.....except the quality of screen materials. It scratches, and I don't mean a little. I have had all types of phones over the years. Flagships to burners, but I have never experienced such a scratch prone one as the Alcatel. I ALWAYS use a case, but have never bothered with a screen protector since I am very careful with my electronics thus the screens remained pristine. I was very proud of my new bargain phone with flagship specs....until I noticed multiple scratches appear out of nowhere. They are increasing as well so the only possible conclusion is the phone was scratched by pulling it in and out of my pocket...seriously! Nobody else touches my phone, no kids, no pets, no nothing. Well the damage is done, I will put up with it I suppose as the other features of the phone are amazing. You have been warned, good luck my fellow shoppers! n
The performance on this phone is really choppy and it has a lot of lag. Your only able to play a few games without lag but graphic intensive games are going to lag you like crazy. I can't even play something like Dumb Ways to Die 2 without lagging incredibly and that game isn't even graphic intensive. Also, when I only use it for a few minutes it gets extremely hot to the touch on the back, even if I'm just browsing the web it will get really really hot to the point that it stings. The camera is okay...its not that great but it performs really well when there is good lighting but with bad lighting it's super blurry and there is really little detail. Opening apps is a pain in the ass because it takes forever for them to open. Just so you know it has a notification light but with only one color and the double tap to wake sometimes is really unresponsive. But two things that's extremely good about this phone is the speakers and the display. The speakers are extremely loud and the display is really sharp and the colors on the phone are pretty accurate has good contrast. The brightness on this phone when turned max is crazy bright and going outside in the sun won't be a worry when using this phone. I gave it a three instead of something lower because of the speakers and display. Oh yeah the headphones that this phone comes with is really awesome but you gotta be really careful around the tip of its plug thingy since if you bend it, it will break. That's what happened to mine. I only had it for a few months and its already broken so I can't even use it to listen and now I have to use my other headphones. n
When I first got it I was blown away by the beautiful screen and incredible speakers. Upon using it for a few months now I have to say that it feels as slow as the Google Nexus (the dual core one by Samsung). The screen managed to develop a tiny yellow spot that seems like someone went over it with a highlighter that won't go away. Buttons are becoming increasingly unresponsive and a refresh of the device hasn't helped.Battery is very average.It's wonderful for watching/listening to shows as the screen still looks pretty decent, especially at that size, the speakers are great, and the included ear buds are pretty decent as well.Still, even after a month of owning this thing I was already disappointed it in. If you need a new phone, it's decent, especially at $250, but the interface is sluggish and unresponsive. n
Got tired of having a contract and over paying for service with a lagy phone that I feel is over priced. This phone has delivered for me exactly what I need, keeps it simple with the OS and features, 2GB are enough for me and my multitasking, it came with an update right out of the box but I have yet to do it. Double tap to wake works, Thou spoty at times, but it works. Great front facing speakers that are loud and clear and the supplied headphones are just perfect. Camera is pretty good, for $250 you get more than what you pay for and the battery life is better than I was expecting, can't go wrong and I have bragged please type to people about this phone. p
Originally I gave this phone a stellar review. However, this phone is a case of you get what you pay for. It stopped charging at 5 week. I just missed the amazon return policy window. n
I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone. p
This phone is really good I recommended to anybody this is a gret phone for the prise p
Wow!! This is a well built phone with all the features from a premium phone. The phone is thin and easy to hold. The screen is bright and clear. The wifi access is good. The camera is decent too. The operating system is close to vanilla android with very little changes. This makes it a breeze to use. The User interface is fast and slick too. So lags what so ever. I did have a small issue with the tray that loads the sim and microsd card and I do not know if it was the SDcard or the tray that was was slightly out of proportions. p
This Phone is really good.Its been few weeks that i bought this phone. I am very satisfied.Thanks for the awesome Amazon Services. p
Not bad for the money. It actually has a feel of a premium high end phone. p
Over all, it's a decent phone, but there's some downsides to it.1. The camera is not going to beat any of the flagship cameras or really any dedicated digital camera.2. It does get hot from time to time (it seems there's similar reports for phones running the Snapdragon 615 chip, so that's the likely culprit).3. Although the screen is very bright, I've noticed it seems washed out from time to time.Aside from these downsides, I think it's still a decent phone over all. Call quality has been good for me. The phone has been plenty fast for most of my tasks which center around web surfing and checking out Facebook. And the battery life is much better than my ancient S3. Over all, it's a phone I would buy again even if Alcatel doesn't provide regular updates (so far according to Reddit it can be rooted and the boot loader seems to be unlocked, so if you feel like experimenting with Cyanogenmod, it may be worth the trouble) in respect to the price. p
I was looking for a good but affordable phone in March/April of this year and I knew already I would have to buy a used or refurbashed phone. Good but cheap phones just do not exist, until now. Alcatel's usual fare is cheap and lackluster POS's with poor hardware. With the Idol 3 Alcatel has decided to up it's game and came out with their new flagship[ phone. Granted it's no high end flagship killer but for the money you get quite a bit of tech.The good- Beautiful, bright and large 5.5" screen. Great visibility in sunlight!- 2 stereo front facing speakers that sound better that any other phone I have heard before.- Near stock Android Lollipop.- 2910mAh battery. Great battery life. On a slow day the phone could last 3 days for me easy. On a busy day it will last the day and then some.- Small dimensions for a big phone. One of the thinnest phones I have ever seen. Very light as well.- Build quality looks excellent. Phone looks sleek and stylish.- Camera is great in optimal conditions. Low light it's poor. Might be fixable in an update.- 16GB storage. I consider anything 16GB or higher a positive.- Storage expandable to 128GB with a micro SD card. I popped one in for my music and it's great (I have over 75GB of music and growing.)- Call quality while not being super is average for a cell phone. If you use the speaker phone option it sounds great.- Phone can be completely used upside down, even on calls!- Reception is great for me. Where as on my Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket I was always getting 1-2 bars. On the Idol 3 I get 3-5 bars. However, reception will very greatly for each person.- SIM unlocked and usable on both AT&T and T-Mobile, including 4G LTE.- Free earbuds. Their not great but their decent and get the job done.- Of course the price!BadBesides the phone not having a removable battery (which is usually a must for me), I personally i can't think of anything bad on this phone. There are a few small things but these should all be fixable on software updates down the road. Alcatel has already conformed they will keep this phone updated for the standard lifespan of a cell phone, usually 18 to 24 months.- Phone can lag a bit. Use the close apps button on the recent apps screen to keep the phone performing optimally. Keeping unused apps out of memory will greatly affect performance. The processor is not the latest and greatest but it does it's job, especially for battery life.- Camera in low light conditions.That's about it for me. I was wary about buying an Alcatel phone as I usually buy either Samsung, HTC or LG but this is a very nice and affordable phone. I highly recommend this phone.*** UPDATE ***Alcatel sent out a performance update less than 2 months after release. I know of only one other company that does faster updates so this is pretty good. I don't know all the things that were in the update but I can say is that it fixed the following issues: UI lag (the user interface no longer has lag when using it), Double Tap to Wake works perfectly now, some minor camera issues were fixed. cell signal dropping sometimes when using LTE was fixed. Also there were a few UI and camera tweaks added as well. Overall the update was great and makes the phone perfect. p
Love the almost stock android, zippy, long battery life. I mean for 250, I got nothing to complain, basic phone with amazing build. p
Ordered 3 of these for myself and family members. Definitely an upgrade from our previous phones. Light, thin, and fast enough for me. Price is right for something pretty close to flagship specs. It does intend to get a bit hot on the back so I just put a case on it. Previous reviews for the press kits pointed that out with the snapdragon 615, but other than that I have no regrets about picking up this phone.Update: August 2nd, 2015. One out of three phones that I ordered just crapped out. LOL. Guess I just had bad luck. Everything was working fine then all of a sudden just started rebooting in a loop. Even did a factory reset and same issue. Definitely a hardware issue. Oh wells. Calling the Manufacturer monday :/ p
Faster than a Nexus 5. Great screen. Excellent battery life. Attractive (unbranded) front face. Overall I'm blown away by this device primarly because of it's price point. There's no reason to pay $600+ for a smartphone these days. p
To preface this review: I am coming from a Nexus 4, which had served me well up till the most recent Android updates, which have been buggy and have killed the battery life on what was previously an almost perfect device.Now, onto the Idol 3: It's a gorgeous phone, with a big, bright & crisp screen and lovely design. The UI has been lightly skinned, which is a good thing as I'm a fan of stock Android. Benchmark scores aren't top notch, but they blow away the Nexus 4 and are just about on par with the Samsung S4. For the price, you're getting a lot of phone here.Yet, there are some significant areas for improvement: Shutter speed is quick but indoor photos are noisy. There's a bit of general UI lag, which isn't that obtrusive. These issues aren't monumental considering the price. More concerning: when browsing certain Flash-heavy sites using Chrome or the stock browse, such as ESPN or Boston.com, the browser lags/stutters to the point that it's essentially unusable. This is a serious issue as we obviously use our phones as portable web browsers a lot. To have a phone that can't navigate well through who knows how many different sites is a near deal-breaker. Other users on various web forums are experiencing the same thing, so it's not just me. Also note that I haven't overloaded the phone with a ton of random apps to muddy the waters.I've only had the phone for a day or two, so hopefully this is a launch issue, but if Alcatel can't push an fix within the next couple of weeks, this thing is going back.3-stars with the stuttering browser issue, otherwise, this is a 5-star phone. n
Absolutely love this device. Once I heard Alcatel was selling a phone with such good specs at such a low price I jumped at the pre-order and I am so glad I did. Although the phone was delivered to my neighbor, and after some worried searching saw it on their porch, I have no problems since my order was upgraded to two day shipping.The device is very light weight and very thin. Its screen is beautiful and very bright. Full, rich color from all viewing angles. The speakers are much better than expected, very loud with solid lows and sharp highs. The headphones provided are of very good quality with phenomenal sound and deep bass. The rear camera is quite good for videos but sub par for stills. The quality in a low light setting is very dull and scratchy. The front camera is a different story. Very rich detail and contrast with a very noticable difference in a low light setting, the pictures are much clearer.The battery is very good. With an average day of usage mostly consisting of YouTube and Facebook I had almost 35% left at the end of the day.The snapdragon processor is a big plus in this device. It is very snappy and holds its own in demanding apps. There is a little lag only when clearing recent apps.The android 5.0 is excellent and very clean on this device.Although the phone is made out of plastic, I must say it has a very durable and quality feel to it. Since the back cannot be removed there is no creaking when force is applied.Overall I must say that this phone is worth every penny and I would highly reccomme d to anybody on a budget. p
Update 7/15/15: Alcatel recently released an update for the phone. While it fixed the double tap to wake issue that previously worked inconsistently, it broke Google Voice interception of outbound calls. Therefore, this phone is nearly unusable to me as a phone, since my primary number is a Google Voice number. As a very inconvenient workaround, I now have to load the Google Voice webpage in order to make a call. I am now considering to replace this phone and do not recommend it to anyone who uses Google Voice to make outbound calls. If you already have this phone and use Google Voice, DO NOT INSTALL THE LATEST UPDATE!---------------------------------------Original review:The Idol 3 is an excellent phone for the $200 pre-order price. At the $250 regular price, I recommend weighing the pros and cons against two-year old flagship phones that sell for a similar price. I am looking forward to Alcatel addressing some of the "cons" listed below with a firmware update.Pros:- Beautiful, 5.5" screen- Good battery life- Android Lollipop experience without the unnecessary clutter- Very good speakers for a cell phone- Micro SD card slotCons:- Double tap to wake feature is so unreliable that it may as well not exist- Minimum volume setting for notifications and ringtones is too loud- Screen sometimes does not go to sleep after set time period- Poorer performance in day-to-day use (non-intensive apps, web browsing, e-mail) than 2-year old flagship phones that now sell for the same price, such as an LG G2- Home screen should have the option of fitting 5 columns of icons instead of just 4- Poorer low-light camera performance than an LG G2 (too much noise)- Non-removable battery- High, hard-to-reach power button n
I am so far neutral on the onetouch. It has a decent screen, expandable memory and a fast enough processor. All of these would have me rating the phone highly for the price it is very nice. However my phone came with a non-functioning gesture keyboard. And if that was not bad enough I attempted to call Alcatel to try and resolve the issue. First I download Alcatel support app, it has a 800 number that is non-functional (strike 1). Then I tried to call a number listed in the manual, no one is there on weekends and holidays, (strike 2). And last but not least is the question who releases a phone so that it arrives on a holiday weekend and does not have support available in any fashion what so ever. (strike 3). While I did fix the keyboard issue by downloading a free keyboard app I would like to have the original equipment/software work properly. Searching on the web found others complaining about the same issue and no help on their website. Buy at your own risk. n
What a steal at $250! This phone definitely holds its own against the 2015 Flagship phones.View some sample pictures from the rear camera. You can see daylight pictures are nice but low-light pictures are noisy.Pros:Price and valueGreat screenLoud speakersLooks very niceCons:Camera doesn't hold up in low light situationsNo wireless chargingOccasional lag due to mid end processorSlippery phoneFind my video review here: https://youtu.be/JU-dDjKi4Ig p
BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR ASAP!!!!I consider myself a pretty careful person when it comes to my electronics. I underestimated myself this weekend and it dropped on the floor of a bus, I was shuffling my feet without knowing the phone was face down on the floor and boom.. scratched screen. Screen protector was already on order and being delivered the following monday :( Totally my fault obviously, but just wanted to warn you guys to definitely get a screen protector and do not chance it with this phone, because almost all the features on this phone are awesome for the price!Screen is beautiful and bright and clear, reminds me of my samsung note 2 AMOLED screen, very clear. keeping the costs down had to be taken somewhere and it is the non scratch resistant screen.Speed seems adequate. I havent really tested its full potential but this is going to be my second phone.sound is AMAZING, JBL speakers and it really shows, Even when plugging it into my car, the sound seems better than my previous phone.Camera app needs some work, or maybe just a different app would work. I was hoping it would take better macro pictures and focus fast on that type of scene but it doesn't for me.size is similar to my note 2, a little bit too big for my hand. But its pretty thin which makes up for that.The power button and volume buttons are high up so reaching them takes some hand maneuvering. you might not think of it much, but once you notice it..Battery life seems pretty good, you could probably get a good day and a half with normal/light usage. It seems like a stock version of android 5.0 lollipop with no bloatware which helps a lot with battery life as well.Overall I think for 200 this is a great deal. Just wish i didn't jump the gun and use it unprotected.Update #1:browsing around the Google app store, I found Open Camera, which is a great alternative to use,. It has a lot of features and macro mode which I was complaining about, and this phone seems to take great macro photos at about 5 inches away.Update #2: Camera app alternativeI had a chance to do some outdoor macro photos and I am VERY impressed with how it did! Using Open Camera and having it on macro mode setting, focusing was for the most part pretty quick and I added some photos to see.Update #3 - 11-5-16 Sold phone a long time ago..Sorry can't provide any further updates on this phone. Judging by the Amazon price for this phone, there are plenty of other phones I would rather get with equal or better specs. p
I was really pleased when I unboxed this phone and set it up via wifi. At that point I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately that changed when I attempted to install the sim and micro sd card. When I inserted the tray into the phone it wasn't recognized and stuck out from the side of the phone just a tiny bit at a slight angle. When I went to remove it and try to reinsert, the tray broke when pulling it back out. I thought maybe I could just get another tray but when I turned the phone over some of the contacts fell out. I have no idea whether this is a design defect or I just got a defective phone but so much for the pre release discount. n
Flagg ship killer p
Excellent phone. Great battery life. No problems whatsoever. Very pleased and highly satisfied p
I love this phone its the best I've had so far p
Nice phone but too many glitches n
I bought 2 of these phones. i love all the features in it. You'll never go wrong with this phone especially the LTE works for AT&T. p
Great for the price. p
I had a lot of issues on the phone that i got through Amazone [battery life, no network etc] and got it replaced, The replacement phone works fine and I donot face any issues. The battery life on my new phone is pretty good and the sound quality is pretty good and i get network coverage all the time.The only time i had an issue with the phone is initially when i tried to get it to connect to LTE and i had to manually do some changes to the APN settings. Apart from that ,the phone works great and its value for money... p
Many reviews seem to be based on high end phone users looking at a value phone, my review is a different angle, I kicked the contract phones my last iPhone was a 5s, went to att pre pay, and the worst phone I ever owned, forget what it was, then to att's best prepay phone I could find at the time, a galaxy express, and it was OK, but getting old, time for a upgrade, looked at all att prepay phones and what a joke, and learned about the whole unlocked phone thing. The idol 3 cost less than my old express did, is a major upgrade in every aspect, screen, speakers, memory, and processer you name it.What lag there is , is nothing like my old express, the idol 3 zips along just fine, a studder closing all apps is all I have found, my express would lock up. Even the camera is leaps over what I had.Do hope to see a 5.1 upgrade?Anyway for a value phone, the idol 3 is hard to beat. Recommenced. p
Great phone. Still learning to use all the features. Works well with the Consumer Cellular phone plan. p
But there are just a few too many issues that it's hard to ignore. Alcatel should absolutely take one more iteration on this phone and they will have something just about perfect.First let's talk about the pros:- Price - absolutely amazing value for the buck- Speedy - plenty fast enough for almost anyone needs, very fee stutters navigating around- camera is actually one of the best I've used outside of a very few phones- almost everything not listed as a con. Seriously this thing is very good overall.Now the cons, which are minor, but eventually they will become deal breakers:- Bluetooth audio is very very hollow sounding. Any media (music, podcasts, phone calls) sounds like you're listening to it over a tin can telephone. If you ever use Bluetooth you'll notice this almost immediately.- Power button in an un-intuitive location. Seriously guys it's standard on Android to have the volume and power button on the right side. Having volume on the right and power on the left is just a needless change. Just put it where everyone else does.- It may just be my device, but a week ago the combination SIM tray and SD card tray (in an of itself a real pain to load and unload) just seemed to stop working. My photos stopped backing up and calls wouldn't go through. I'd get a replacement but with the other issues I'll just get a refund.Again I really like the idea Alcatel was going for and they should definitely just fix these few issues and will have a great flagship-level phone. n
It's a good phone but if you use it to browse the web a lot it's lack of memory hurts the experience... Scrolling webpages become a unpleasant experience... Hopefully the next version will have more memory wich would fix this issue. n
Good price. fast shipping. p
I adquiro this cell at a good price, and I only have a few days with him, so far I 'm surprised with all epesifiaciones and options , general .. rapidez..Todo cell is adata you. It is good team and if cuidas- best that price .. p
Display very easy to crack, once cracked, (just a tiny crack) will become totally touch unresponsive, unlike other phones .won't buy an alcatel again n
My first smart phone. It will take me a while to use all its capacity. I just heard about an app that is a magnifier, which I really need. Asking "Okay Google" has replaced Wikipedia as my new helpmate. Great price too. p
Honestly will never buy a NAME brand phone again. My wife and I go through phones. You know the $600+ ones about every 6 months. This phone is faster than my LG G4, my Galaxy s6, and her Galaxy Note 4. Just plain and simple phone that does everything well. p
Bought this phone for my mother as her work phone. Very pleased with the built, though plastic and light. The Screen is bright and the os is basically a google skin. Great sounds and smooth in operating. I wouldn't recommend if you like to load your phone with apps and games. If You are basic with a few chat apps and fb, this is more than enough ram. Lastly very attractive, even next to my Samsung note 5 it looks every bit the cost. Kudos. p
I love this phone!! I wanted a phone that was not too expensive, was large, and was Android 5. I did extensive research and was led to this phone. I was not familiar with the brand, but it has proved to be a wise choice. This is my first cell phone and I am happy to not have to use my teens phone.The value for the price is exceptional. If you are on the fence, don't be. This is the one p
Everything positive that has been said about this phone is true. But the face chat is not that great. I didn't have any complaints until I called my friend and we chatted over the video phone camera. And I don't know why but when I go to google images, the pixels on the images are pretty bad. I've never had issues with that on any phone, and I've had the Alcatel fierce 2. So I gave it 3 stars for that reason. n
Great budget phone, nice screen, pretty quick and very little bloatware, most of what is there can be uninstalled. p
To start off the is a decent phone for its generation, clear screen and feels good in hand nice weight.Unfortunately the sim card stop registering and google play didn't open. Phone work for about a week.The sim card was fine we placed it into a different phone worked properly. In all its old and slow but looks and feels nice. n
Great display and sound, beautiful look p
This phone is great! I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn. p
love it. p
Great performance, never run into any lagging. Nice and thin and fits well in my pocket (I was used to a 4" phone!). Great screen and battery life. Dropped one star because the camera isn't all that great, particularly in low light. p
I have been using this phone for two months now. My previous phone was an HTC One M7 Google Play Edition. And I have to say, I am pleasantly surprised. The phone is blazingly fast, the screen is absolutely awesome, you can see it clearly in full midday sunlight, it is BRIGHT!! The battery life on this thing is awesome, a very good camera, very loud and decent sounding speakers, a very close to vanilla android, and last but not least, TIMELY ANDROID UPDATES!! For me it was the choice between an LG G4 or this one, and I am glad I bought this one and saved a lot of money too. p
The idol 3 met all my expectations from reading all the reviews posted. If ur on the fence about purchasing this unit I suggest you pull the trigger. p
This really is an amazing phone! I made the shift from an iPhone 4s 3 mos. ago and have enjoyed the learning curve from iOS to android with the Idol 3. It's kept up with day to day processes and battery life has been great. Its a bit oversensitive at times, meaning it'll activate apps on its own, but not a dealbreaker. I've gotten a lot of compliments on the looks of this idol3 and for the price I'm very happy! By the way, it takes decent pics too! p
I was loving this phone - the beautiful display! the amped front-facing speakers! the near-stock android lollipop experience running very smoothly! Then, it happened. I don't know how it happened which is the hardest part because I woke up last Sunday morning to a broken digitizer. I pulled the phone out of the lower pocket of my cargo shorts that it had resided in several times since purchase and there it was - that inch-long crack across the top right corner of the screen. Along with it came the disabled lower half of the screen to any input.I ordered a digitizer on ebay for $25 despite the lack of online tutorials for replacing anything on this new-ish phone. Please note - it is not very difficult to get into, but you will find it nearly impossible to reassemble this phone without having rendered it completely useless during disassembly!The design (speakers near the edges) doesn't lend itself to any sort of meaningful case usage.So, here I am back to using my nearly 3 year old Samsung Galaxy S4 :(I tried, Alcatel. n
Loved everything about the phone except the camera which totally sucked if you didn't have the perfect lighting situation. If having a good camera isn't important to you then it's a good phone. n
I absolutely LOVE this phone. I switched from a Galaxy S6 Edge because the Edge was constantly lagging and stuttering. I couldnt believe how terrible it was--a $750 phone!!! So, I did my due diligence and researched sub $300 phones that I could replace it with. I came across the one touch 3 and the ASUS Zenfone. I decided to go with the One Touch because although it has less processor capacity and ram than the Zenfone it made up for it in battery longevity, screen quality, and front facing speakers.The reviews were so right. The screen is beautiful. The front facing speakers sound just as good as on the HTC One M9. I have not experienced ANY of the lag I experienced on the S6 Edge (probably because there is little to no bloatware running in the background.)The battery also provides about 1.5 hours more screen on time than the S6.Get this phone. You wont be disappointed. I promise. p
A great phone for the money. If you don't have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones. p
So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, "Whoa, that is impressive". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money. p
I"m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked. n
I'm very pleased with the product, It met my expectations. p
Absolutely love it. Exceeded my expectations for a phone in this price range. Display is great as well as best sound I've heard on any phone. p
best budget 5.5 screen android phone why buy samsung or apple for three times the price. great camera and responsive quick phone p
This device works with mexican phone carriers, i bought this and the speakers sounds very loud does not need any from an iphone, samsung any other brands p
I like it,but the speakers are no that great and the pictures are ok. p
Very good, smooth and solid phone. I really liked it. p
Incredibly poor build quality, in my limited experience. The first phone I received had a failed LCD panel when I took it out of the box (box and packaging had no visible damage). The second one's LCD panel is seperating from the phone's casing and I've been very gentle with it for the few months I've had it. Given this 0/2 track record so far as the two I've received, I can't recommend this phone, especially since purchasing the international version (this version) via Amazon means you won't have a manufacturer warranty for any defects or repairs.The phone also performs more poorly than the Moto G 3rd Gen (same price range, but better build quality) on the original firmware, the newest official firmware, and several of the third party firmwares I've tried (CM, BlissPop, RR, and others). n
Droped it once doesn't work any more. Durability very low.. nice phone though n
Premium phone for the price of a baisc phone. Love it!!! p
Its an excellent phone. much better than I expected. Great screen.Good baytery life.Audio quality through headphones and speakers are good. My only problem is with the sensitivity of the screen; its not reliable. Overall great phone for the price p
- It has a good design, is very light, thin and symmetrical, which also used to use one of its most striking features, reversibility: does not matter as lame, the screen rotates for use in the right direction, even to take calls . That also has duplicates p
ok p
It's not the best but it's pretty good for the price n
The product is great. Its a great value for your money! The 1080p screen is gorgeous and the phone is surprisingly light. I had to get the case on it just to make it a bit heavy to feel something in hand. The resolution is on par with iPhone 6/7Plus edition.Its amazing how affordable this phone is with the kind of features that are packed. Not to mention, having not to figure out how to hold the phone when the phone rings and ability to accept the phone both ways is amazing!Surprisingly its the closest stock andriod experience that I ever had. No bloatware at all. The speakers are amazing and includes the JBL headset which is top notch. At this price point, this is close to a steal. p
I've been very pleasantly surprised by this phone. My last phone was a Samsung Galaxy S3 and so far this just blows that out of the water. Great, front-facing speakers (for a phone, at least), solid connectivity and web browsing experience, nice sleak design, impressive battery life. It has everything I need in a phone for the right price. p
Great cell. I buy with 99.99 offer, great deal. p
Great build quality, minimal bloat ware, great sounding speakers, pretty ok call quality, looks good. I'm really a Windows Phone guy but thought I'd try Android for fun. Not to bad. I have however loaded it up with WP features and launchers. Got for $99.99 lucky me well worth it. p
Amazing phone for the price. If you're looking for a good Android device and don't want to throw down a chunk, this is well worth it. p
i have had this phone for 2 months now and I do not regret buying it. It is super amazing. p
Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet p
Great phone, really loved the quality of the build. feels a quality product very good value for Money. p
Just recieved the Idol 3 phone by Alcatel. I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone! p
This phone is amazing . I have a galaxy s4 purchased new when it came out 5 years ago . This phone is right there with it except its bigger and 10 times brighter and vibrant compared to my s4 phone. When My s4 finally dies out this will be waiting to replace it .the only thing they need to mark is where the sim card removal tool is it took me 20 minitues trying to find it p
Super phone. Poor battery. p
This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well. p
Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too. n
I received a paper stapler . not buy cell.The order gives me the option to open a claim as I do please . n
I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoyingâ€¦ but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. Itâ€™s VERY Annoying and I canâ€™t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not "perfect". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations? p
At this price I think that Idole 3 can be considered one of the best smartphones on the market.It is a good device and very easy to handle.PRO: LTE frequencies working with AT&T and other US carriers, Android Lollipop, excellent and brilliant screen, very good cameras (front camera is 8 mp!), excellent stereo speakers, good battery.CON: processor MSM8939 is not fast: avoid multitasking! audio during calls could have a little more clarity. p
Fantastic screen, good performance, good battery life. Overall: A+ p
yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK p
Headphones are missing p
Very practical phone: large screen, lightweight, and high sound quality. p
Far better than my Galaxy s4 or note 2, much better battery and faster than eitherI have a lot of apps, and it is not laggy at all, but I use Nova launcher which is greatThe only negative is that the double tap function often does not work. I don't know if this is a phone issue or Android or Novalauncher. p
I'm a phone guy and used almost every phone out there. This device is great for the normal consumer who is looking for something nice and gets the job done! The camera is good not great but good. Gets the job done to leave a good memory of something you want to snap a quick photo of. The battery is pretty decent. previous device was a Oneplus one so I got spoiled with great battery life. For being a $250 device this is a great deal and great value! p
Phone came and I was quite surprised at how light it was and big compared to my nokia 925. The front facing speakers sounds great and the reversible screen is plain ol' genius, makes perfect sense. No more fumbling for your Phone, it has a lag to it when your performing some task (mainly task manager), but its ok. Good battery life (for the screen size), I get a whole day out of a charge. I really love the phone, especially because I've always bought unlocked phones but this one does it all at a fraction of the cost!!!! Highly recommended. Get tons of compliments on the look and sound quality......Sad to say I took the case off the phone to swap out my sd card and dropped the phone and wouldn't you know it, the screen cracked in the upper right corner. now the touch is inconsistent making the phone useless. Lets see how good Alcatels customer service is, wish me luck. Will update with outcome p
I've had this phone for a week and must say it lives up to the hype. A great midrange phone for budget price. $250 is a steal and I envy you who got the $199 deal.If you know this phone exists then you've most likely already seen reviews, you already know the good. You're here because you want to know what's bad right?ConsButton Placement - Its like this phone is made for lefties, I don't know what Alcatel was thinking when they inserted the power button WAYYY to the top left. You'll try to substitute with double tap to wake but it only works .75 of the time and you'll find it better to simply click the power button. The up/down volume buttons is something it will take a LONG TIME getting use to. I'm so used to the volume buttons being on the mid-left instead of top right... What were they thinking!? LolConnection - When I first got the phone it seemed to drop connection a bit, I'd say 1/5 calls. I was kinda pissed at first BUT the past 3 days it hasn't dropped any and I make lots of phone calls since I'm a supervisor and have a lot of unreliable employees. Also I live in Miami not like in the middle of no where so I have good reception.Camera - If you're coming from a high end device this rear facing camera won't impress you. Coming from a 8MP Galaxy S3 I'd say this camera JUST gets the job done. This camera is pretty bad at catching light if you take a picture at 12PM it looks like it was taken 6PM. Take it at 7PM it looks like it was taken 11PM. If you post 10 pictures on IG & FB everyday you'll probably want to aim for something with a better camera.Not trying to poop on the camera because like I said it gets the job done.In contrast the 8MP front facing camera is great. One of the few phones on the market with something above a 5MP front facing camera.Those are the only small negatives I can think of BUT its not really deal breaking which is why I still gave it 5 stars. If you're on the fence just click purchase you won't regret it. If so simply return it within 30 days. ðŸ˜„ p
Excellent phone, poor documentation. p
Awesome phone. Had to return it due to signal issues. I will probably buy it again after some updates get released. p
After about a week of use, I have very little to complain about with this phone. The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid. I'm still mastering the camera, finding that tapping the subject of your photo before taking does a great job of setting the proper exposure, especially in shots where there's something brighter than your subject elsewhere in the photo. p
Amazing value. Great phone. Great reception. Excellent display. Good speakers. Updates are a bit flaky. First one messed up texting functionality and the third threw my phone into an endless reboot cycle. I ended up booting in safe mode, and eventually got the phone to boot again without having to wipe it. Sharing videos over email is still broken, which is very annoying. Maybe the next update will fix it. Only downside of this device is that it doesn't ship with stock Android, although it's pretty close (very few software enhancements and no bloatware). p
So I decided to spend less on a phone after I broke last phone. I gave this phone a shot because I liked the aesthetics of it and reviews said it had a great screen and sound. So far I love everything about the phone except for the processor, if I could upgrade it to a snapdragon 800 series this phone would be perfect. The phone is a little laggy at times, but for the price that is to be expected a little bit. The screen and sound are awesome, camera is good enough for me, and it has a sd card slot. Overall I'm quite impressed especially since I got it on sale. Minus one star for the processor. p
The phone is great, love it! p
Been using the Idol 3 as my daily driver over the past week and so far I'm very impressed. The Idol 3 has a bright high resolution screen, loud front facing speakers, good battery life, solid build quality and runs near stock Android. Also comes with JBL earbuds. I'd definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking for an unlocked smartphone for less than $300. p
Very nice speakers, good for music and movie. Slow cpu wish come with 3 gb of memory p
I've had a N5 since launch. The N5 was a great phone for me other than the horrendous battery life. Fast forward to the present and I wanted even more screen real estate. I knew I wanted at least 5.5", maybe even 6". I just couldn't justify spending north of $400+ for a N6, G4, S6, etc though. When the Idol went for sale for $180 on Amazon Prime Day I had to take the chance even though this phone was completely off my radar. The Idol 3 makes the Nexus 5 feel/look like old newsIdol 3 as compared to the Nexus 5:**Screen**The screen is just as good as the N5, I'd say even better as there isn't horrendous white light bleed along the edge at extreme viewing angels. The extra half inch really makes a difference in media consumption.**Battery**Oh wow! It's nice to have a battery again!I had a QI wireless charger for my N5 at work. Probably a good thing too or I would have sold my N5 a long time ago as we all know the battery blows on the N5. While I'd prefer that the Idol had wireless charging ability, I can live without it as I can easily get 2 days of use. It's so odd looking at the battery percentage and not see it drop like a rock during the day. I need to look into aftermarket wireless micro usb charger + case to conceal it. Hopefully I can find the thinnest most "stock" looking combo.**Speakers**The speakers? OMFGBBQ!!! I sometimes listened to the N5 streaming music on it's lone speaker when working on projects. It provided fill and it passed the time. The Idol's speakers are exponentially better. Heck I don't even think I've had them over 3/4 volume. I don't think I can buy another phone that DOESN'T have two forward facing speakers now. I'm spoiled now.**Performance**Feels on par with my N5. Yeah I see a stutter here and there when loading a page or what not but it's in no way a deal breaker for me.**Reception**I'm on TMO's $30 5gb prepaid plan and I get crap for cellular reception in my house. Luckily I get LTE @ my work. So I've completely converted to Google Hangouts VOIP. I use wifi @ home for calls, LTE data while I'm away from the house. After a week things have been great so far for my coverage and use.**Feel**Lighter, thinner than the N5. Only con is the Idol is a slippery sob! I really have to mind my Ps and Qs when handling it. I like my phones to be naked as I don't like the bulk. However I think I'll have to just bite the bullet and get a case for this, not only for the wireless charging listed above, but for grip as well as protection cause yeah I don't think the Idol is gonna take well to abuse :(**Conclusion**Well I was able to sell my N5 for $180 on CL in a day. Since I basically stole the Idol for $180 from that Amazon sale I got a GREAT upgrade for free :) I'm a happy camper.Now that the boot-loader is unlocked on the Idol I'm anxiously awaiting how performance will increase with a custom rom. Good times. p
Ok was very disappointed when I got y phone and turned it on it asked me to do an update I did and I couldn't do anything with it after all I had was a black screen so I had to do a hard reset and NOT DO THE UPDATE...now I'm very happy with my phone for now ....I just got it yesterday.update I LOVE THIS PHONE p
This phone is great for the price. Has all of the state of the art features that other high grade smart phones have. Love the slim design. Better that buying a phone through ATT Next and being stuck for $15 -25/month for 30 months. p
It is a great phone that exceeded my expectations. The stock camera app cannot lock the focus under indoor lighting. But I solved the problem by downloading a free app "A Better Camera". An added bonus, I now have descent cellular signal that my previous 3 phones couldn't get in my office. Very satisfied so far. p
Has been an amazing device for the price. Perfect for anyone who wants a quality experience on a budget. p
A 4! Because of the sim tray, don't like the back to back design, cards did and could get stuck, got to be very careful!! outside of that this device rocks! Thanks p
Beautiful, works great just advertised. Only problem was getting it set up by consumer cellular. It took four agents to finally get it right. Two agents and a supervisor told me it wouldn't work with their system. I'm so glad I persisted until I got a customer service rep that knew what to do. Great battery life. Since it is new I'll have to wait and seehow it works long term. p
Sent back very laggy when using chrome n
excellent good phone all I would like to work more in the chamber for dark shots p
Pros:Speakers are loudest I've heardDisplay is bright and vividThe speed is pretty fast once you remove the minimal bloat, especially the antivirusVery lightweightBattery life was decentCons:Bad LTE receptionCamera wasn't very good, the flash is way too weak so low light is abysmalTap 2 wake is spotty, sometimes because it's slow to wake up. I'd rather just disable itUgly branding on the back. Sticker would solve thisNot many cases out thereOverall:I returned this thing. A phone that loses signal (0 bars!) between towers on the 405 freeway in LA? I'm not T-Mobile, and my cheap old LG F6 was a beast compared to this. My new LG G4 picks it up fine, too. I gave the Idol 3 a chance. Did Alcatel not even test this one bit in the field? What good is band 12 if I have trouble with band 4?!?! n
I'll admit it, I've got a phone problem. I tire of phones quickly and also get irritated by them. I've used nearly every flagship device on the market. This device keeps pace with any flagship that's a generation old and blows away mid range device it's designed to compete with.The camera is good, voice calls are good, display is excellent even in direct light, and it's responsive even when multi tasking.You may not like the fixed battery or the almost stock Android. Samsung, HTC, and LG all have "skins" that make for a nicer user experience.I will update my review with real battery life numbers. 2 days in the battery seems like plenty to get you through a day.Before you fork over $30 per month for the next 2 years, or worse yet sign a contract, give this phone a shot. p
Great smart phone. Gets a bit sluggish from time to time, but I still like it. It's big, thin and the battery last all day. A bang for the buck! p
I Like it alot. Good loud speakers and great looking screen, quick and snappy on apps. It does have some bloatware but can get it out easily enough. I just wished this model had an otterbox defender or something as strong. p
This phone is great (for the price I paid) when it worked. After a few month, the screen on mine cracked and rendered the phone unresponsive to touch; therefore, useless. I had a silicone case and temper glass protective screen on since the first day. Never drop the phone or abuse it in anyway, the screen just cracked for no reason while the phone was in my pocket by itself. Unfortunately, physical damage is not covered under warranty. Be warned! n
Came in two days. We ordered it for our younger cousin. So far so good. We may update once she gets it turned on and going. But you shouldn't get much complaint from a 16 yr old. lol p
Average phone with very buggy performance n
I just got a replacement of this device and it auto restarts like crazy......I wish I didn't have to have this phone anymore n
It only gets 1 star bc it kept shutting itself off. It would freeze then shut off in the middle of me doing something. Or I could b across the RM and my phone would shut off. Not sure if I just got a bad one or not but I couldn't have my phone shutting off every few seconds. n
This is a phone that I have thoroughly enjoyed. I have been a buyer of Alcatel phone for the last few years and have been happy with their product. However, this phone is one of their best. The only problem I've had seen doing a software update is when the ringer turns itself down to soft which makes hearing a call coming in very difficult to receive. I'm not saying this is normal, but, it has happened with the phone I just received. Amazon has been amazing in the fact that they are replacing my phone due to the circumstances.It is worth its cost and more. You can't go wrong with buying this phone. p
Incredible phone and the best for its price. It does everything your average smartphone user wants and does it well. Clean stock android, great screen, and the best speakers I've heard on a smartphone. (Seriously these things are loud). I couldn't see anyone being disappointed with recieving this phone. p
I bought this phone because it was capable of supporting 700mhz band 12 LTE which has better building penetration. Unfortunately, Alcatel was unable to design the phone to support VoLTE, and realized it only after marketing the phone to be compliant. The entire band 12 must be disabled to prevent a situation where the user would be unable to reach emergency services. The phone has lost a lot of value in my eye as a result. If I had known that band 12 would it be supported, I would have purchased a different phone. n
Very glitchy and not very easy to use. The screen and sound are great though. n
My screen keeps poppin up it's broke or something. Would buy a different phone n
works great p
Heavenly! p
good. p
I love this phone with a clear screen and good sound. It doesn't come stuffed with apps I don't use. I like that it takes a storage card. I can get through a day with it before needing to charge its battery most days. When I was traveling, and constantly using it for navigating, taking pictures, getting information about where I was and what I was seeing, I did need to plug it into an external battery pack by late afternoon. This phone does everything much more expensive phones do if you don't want or need VR. I hope Alcatel will continue to make elegant, simple phones like the Idol3. p
I like this cell phone ! p
Awesome phone for a hundred bucks. Could not beat it. p
Very worth for the price p
Works great, easy upgrade to Marshmallow. Well built. Don't wait! This is last years flagship and won't be around long. No problems with TMobile. p
After only three weeks the phone screen has cracked in my pocket, rendering the touch screen inoperable. The phone's screen is so weak it could not survive a brisk jaunt around the city. On top of this, when I tried to repurchase a replacement phone, my order was cancelled by Alcatel but my funds were still removed from my account. I had to go through this TWICE and I had to hassle both my bank and Alcatel customer service to get my money back. The Alcatel customer service reps. were less than helpful and borderline apathetic to the matters.Based on my experiences it seems like Alcatel is an unscrupulous company peddling threadbare phones and has a piss-poor customer service infrastructure to hand their shoddy craftsmanship.Avoid Alcatel at all costs n
This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior. p
good p
Surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. Have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. Has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. Able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything. p
Quality is amazing for the price .. Audio is nice, camera quality is pretty decent, charges very quickly and lasts for the day.. Well (It depends on how much you use it.) But to be honest, this is by far the best 100 bucks I've ever spent ðŸ˜Advise: Get a screen protecter, preferably glass and you're fine. p
Phone died after 30 days of use. Tried to restart phone, but phone started continuously powering on and off, rendering it unusable. A quick google search reveals that this is a common problem for this phone. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy it. n
Excellent phone for the price! Huge screen, beautiful, very light and the best speakers in a phone. Also the speakers are up and down and front facing so if you use it landscape mode you get excellent stereo (and loud) sound (e.g., for videos). p
Thin and fast, nice screen p
Bought this smartphone for just $99 here 2 weeks ago.GoodThe screen is the best that I ever seen (comparative with iPhone 6+). The JBL stereo speakers are fantastic! Ultra clear sound! Android 6.0.1 in the latest update OTA made this phone very fast.BadBoth cameras are rather weak in a poor light places. Even my old iPhone 5 takes much better photos in low light places without a flash. The rear camera is OK in a daylight. Although I still prefer iPhone 5 for taking photos.I've already noticed that the phone lost wifi connection 2 times being connected to the charger. That is strange.According to the reviews here any screen protector is a must have thing for this phone. p
Great full featured phone at a great price. p
Bought this phone on pre order. Nice screen, perfomance was ok and got better with the Marshmallow update, audio quality was amazing, also the included headphones were nice (they lasted 8 months). Phone stoped working one week after the warranty expired. n
Awesome phone. Crystal Clear display. Loud speakers. I don't see the lag issues other have reported. Updated software and I am pleased with the camera. Looking forward to Android 5.1 update from Alcatel. p
It is an amazing phone p
This is defiantly the best phone I have ever owned! The speakers are phenomenal! They are loud, clear, and do have a little bit of bass! The display is also one of the best on any budget phone! Also the camera isn't bad either! But to wrap it all up, this is the best phone under $300! p
I've had this phone for about a month & I have nothing but good thing to say about it. Here's what I think after one month:PRO- Inexpensive, loud stereo speakers, some nifty & unique features, good (day) camera & very slim profile and not to mention very light- Good battery: the battery should last a day even with heavy use. I'm not a heavy user and mine actually lasted one & half day with single charge.- Bright large 5.5" full HD (1080P) screen.- Unlocked, no contract and no preloaded garbage apps- Able to add more memory up to 128 GB using microSD card.CONS- Handling: This is a big phone so the combination of size, thinness and low weight will be an issue for small hands.- Performance is somewhat sluggish when compared to my older phones such as LG G3, Note 3 and my Fire phone.- Low light photography - Indoor & @ night, must use flash.- Battery is not replaceable.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -This is my second Alcatel phone. After my first one which was returned promptly I vowed not to buy another but after reading the reviews & partly because of Amazon one day special sale (got it for $199) I gave it a try. And now, I think this phone is worth every penny. This is by far the best phone Alcatel has made. They were able to put some mid to premium features into this phone and sell at a very low budget price.DESIGN & BUILTThis phone is very elegent. It got rounded edges framing a metalic like body. The screen sits slightly over the JBL speakers on top and bottom which makes the overall look very unique. The back camera takes great outdoor photos during the day but at night you'll need to use flash.SPECIAL FEATURES- Reversible interface - Phone has speakers and microphone on top and bottom and once you activate the feature, it doesn't matter which side you hold up to make or receive calls. I've never seen this feature on any other phone before.- Double-tap lock screen feature - They copied this from LG G series phones. The implementation of it though is somewhat sluggish. You have to tap it a few times before the screen turns on or off.CAMERA- IDOL3 has a 13-megapixel auto-focus rear camera, and an above average 8-megapixel front-facing for selfies. The lens is flush to the back, so thereâ€™s no raised section like the new iPhone or Galaxy S6 and others. On the software side, the layout is simple but it does come with a variety of shooting modes and interestingly there is also a manual mode with shutter speed control. The camera delivers decent looking photos in moderately lit conditions with nice details and saturated colors. However, it seems to struggle with low lit situation and with no flash, you get hazy details with some noticeable noise. But on the plus side, it does have electronic image stabilization feature which helps to keep things steady especially when you're working with the manual mode with low shutter speed. Also the latest OTA update has significantly improved the camera's performance. Colors look nicer, it focus better and snaps photos faster. If you get this phone be sure to get the latest OTA update.BATTERY PEFORMANCEThe 2910 mAH last me the full day and even after 24 hours I still had 30% left and so this is one big plus for this phone.Overall I highly recommend this phone. There are very few phones that can match the features with such a low price. Oneplus one (last year version) which is now readily available is the one of only two true competitor. That phone is faster but its 64 GB version is $75 more and with IDOL 3 you can add up to 128 GB of SD so from that standpoint its ahead. The other phone is Zenfone 2 which is $50 more but from what I read, there's a lot of shortcoming with that phone. Anyway, if you're looking for a feature rich, low price, no contract phone, you can't go wrong with IDOL 3. p
Best Phone I've owned so far, it is just amazing. i Love it. it is just as described. The sound quality is amazing, the Speed, the Camera, the gaming capabilities, watching videos on this device gives you the best experience, everything about this phone is awesome.For only $250.00 this is the best phone there is. p
I'm glad I waited when it dropped in price to purchase this and yes I love it cause I'm hard of hearing and the speakers are loud for me, unlike other devices I've had. I would recommend this for anyone who's hard of hearing.I was deciding between this and the Asus ZenFone2 and went by reviews both had good reviews, but I went with the Idol.The camera is good, but I use a different camera app with it for more effects.The battery life is great and it charges quickly more than an Android tablet I have.The screen is nice and clear, the ease of access is good and Alcatel does do the update, for it when it lets you know for an OTA.The only non-issues I have that's there's not enough accessories being the fact it's been out for a few months. Been looking for a Qi charging receiver, tho Alcatel has one, but no one has made a review for it on here. B 3 bottom right is what I'm searching for.I really don't do reviews, but this I thought I would do. p
For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180Â° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too. p
Got this when my Nexus 5 died and was amazed at the progress made in android phones since I got the N5 a year ago. For less than half the price of my N5 I got a phone with comparable screen, better battery (being able to charge my phone 1/day is a game changer), better speakers, better camera. Granted the Idol doesn't have the benchmarks of the N5 (or the ZenPhone2) but I haven't noticed it at all in everyday use.If you want a great unlocked phone (with all the GSM LTE bands) and don't want to pay $600, get this phone. p
Terrible call quality, multiple people told me during calls on speakerphone that I sounded far away and that they couldn't hear me well. Maybe it's due to the speakers during calls. I promptly returned. I wonder if the 4.7 inch version also has this same problem n
Great phone while it worked right but still Luke other Alcatel phones the power button failed to work n
Great phone for the price. p
I love the phone. It works perfectly. p
This is a great phone and a good price. It is comparable to any other big name phone out there at the moment and only a fraction of the cost. Works great with StraightTalk and Net10 services.It is a very thin phone compared to most so. I felt like I may break it because its so thin, but it has held up well. Adding a tempered glass screen protector made it feel a lot more sturdy. p
overall a very good phone and great value for its price.would love to have physical buttons, though, used to the samsung notes. there's sufficient real estate to put that in also. p
Its doesn't have the Samsung or the Apple brand name but don't let that stop you. The screen is fantastic, the speakers are loud and i easily get one and a half days off of a single charge with heavy use. for $250.00 you get a phone that can do almost everything that any other flagship phone can do and in some cases more. (it has SD card slot and NFC). Please note though that it does not use gorilla glass. i got a couple scratches on my screen pretty early on. It could just be from me being careless but i would strongly recommend buying a case. its a pretty thin phone so it shouldn't be a problem p
Lots of features for the price. Nice screen. Definitely made me wonder why my Motorola Nexus 6 is priced so much higher. (I got the Alcatel for my mother.)However, the SD card/SIM dual tray is awful. I couldn't get a SIM card inside, without ripping out the SD card electronics. Phone still works, but that terrible design choice makes me wary. n
I read Amazon reviews on this product, and determined that the Alcatel ONETOUCH IDOL 3 would fit my needs perfectly due to the product specifications and price point. I could not be more wrong. I have switched brands of cell phones over the years, varying from Apple, LG, Motorola RAZR, Nokia, and even Cingular phones. Nothing I have used in the last ten years has been as fragile and poorly made as this one. While reaching into my pocket to read a text message I just received, I went to swipe my phone to unlock. However, the glass surface (digitizer) of the phone would not recognize my swipes, and started trying to swipe all on its own. I thought this was bizarre, and upon closer inspection there were some small cracks on the top left corner of the phone. After trying to swipe further, the crack spread all the way from the top left to the center right of the digitizer, effectively making the phone useless. Since this was in my pocket previously, I have no idea how it cracked, since it was working fine and had no issues throughout the day. It is utterly pathetic that this product broke INSIDE my pocket, and their customer service team has been even worse in terms of honoring any warranty or protection from this brittle, cheaply-made phone. I would recommend any other smartphone instead of this one, because it is not acceptable in 2015 to have phones so fragile you must bubble wrap them before storage.Summary: If you are looking for an unlocked phone, go with another brand, because it will actually work and not break inside your pocket within two months of purchase. Just go here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/wireless/2407749011/ref=s9_acsd_ri_bw_clnk?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_r=0MPS87YSGRVP9GKHPS5D&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=2153843082&pf_rd_i=2407749011_p0_h) and make sure whatever you do, never, EVER get an Alcatel ONETOUCH Idol 3. n
I do not like the camera. it has a vary shallow field, there will be a small area in the four ground that is clear and everything else is blurry. don't expect to be getting any quick shots with this phone, you have to hold it perfectly still. I f the camera is important don't but this phone; it is terrible.The JBL sound is really nice, the phone sounds great. one of my priority needs since I like to listen to music while walking.The phone runs smooth with apps loading relatively quickly.. p
Great phone for the price paid. p
Phone stopped working after a software update in just month 2 of ownership. I have made 5 attempts to get phone fixed through customer service and have been unsuccessful each time. Do not buy. n
I wanted to give the phone 5 stars...but some worries keep me from it. The good stuff is outstanding, and what little bad stuff there is is easy to overcome. It's an amazing phone for a great price point. Except...(I'll get to that in a minute).PROS:--Great screen and visibility. Even in bright sunlight and from different angles, the screen is sharp and easy to see. I purchased a tempered glass screen protector, but that might be overkill.--The internal radios are fine. I have no trouble picking up AT&T LTE signals.--Super stereo effect from the twin JBL speakers with good volume when listening in speaker mode.--Great form factor. Though the phone is big, it's very slim and fits the hand easily, and it looks great. I bought a sturdy case in part to keep the screen from contacting tabletops and to give it a little extra "grip," though.--For basic day-to-day use, the battery is amazing. With ordinary call activity and web surfing, I can get 2+ days easily.--The flip feature, letting you use the phone easily right side up or upside down is really cool.--While some complain about the placement of the power button high on the left edge, I like it. I tend to use the phone in my left hand, so that works well for me.--It's (almost) pure Android, so very intuitive.--The cameras produce excellent photos in decent light...but...MINOR CONS:--As others have noted, the pix are noisy in less-than-ideal lighting. The preloaded camera app is awkward to use, but I simply added Open Camera (free on Google Play).--Several of the other pre-loaded apps are weak to worthless, but easy enough to ignore.--For as good as the speakers are in speakerphone mode, they sound rather tinny in standard mode.MAJOR CON:--Here's what has me worried. This baby gets REALLY hot really quickly when watching videos or playing games. I'm concerned that over time, that will be a huge issue for battery longevity. I'm not a big gamer or video watcher, but if you are, you'd be well served looking for something else. p
It's a decent phone and very attractive looking. Coming from using an S5 Galaxy, it's lacks many custom features on the messaging app that comes by default on S5. Can't personalize view, can't schedule text messaging, very limited message size - etc. The camera on the ph lacks decent zoom. Otherwise, there is nothing wrong with this phone from a hardware perspective. n
T-Mobile talked Alcatel into removing band 12 now I have no LTE signal another piece of junk T-Mobile phone. If you have T-Mobile and one of these there is a class action lawsuit being filed against Alcatel for doing it. I have a less than 3 month old paperweight now !!!!! I am not buy another Alcatel anything and dropping T-Mobile because this is the reason they are still number 3 !!!! DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK IF YOU ARE A T-MOBILE CUSTOMER IT WILL OTA AN UPDATE AND THAT WILL MAKE IT USELESS !!!!! n
Best phone in its budget, still prefer my one plus 2 but so dope p
Love this phone takes awesome pictures and is good for music has amazing sound. p
Phone looks good. But not comparable to other similar phones. I had T-Mobile SIM card, it does not work some times. Camera stopped working completely. When I start camera App, it closes automatically. I installed other camera Apps, only front camera works. Back camera does not work.Overall, I don't recommend this phone.I called customer service. Nobody answers and get disconnected after 1 or 2 mins. Tried several times, it is same. n
works ok with T-Moble. I love the phone itself. p
I bought this phone in July of 2015, and I loved it so much, but I do speak of it in the past tense for a reason. The beginning of June 2016 it died on me. The phone is now just boot loops every time I try to turn it on. I tried to get ahold of the customer service, and they tried to talk me through resetting it through the boot menu(which I had already done), and the call dropped, and they never called me back. I would love to give it a better review, but less then a year later it is as good as a brick. n
Flagship features at budget price p
This phone is HORRIBLY slow. It crashes at least once a week. Android device manager doesn't locate it. n
I cannot compare this Smartphone to any other product because this is the only smart phone I've ever had.I bought it a year ago because it was unlocked and I could use my Tracfone Account and because of its many features so that I could use it for virtual reality, gaming and 4G LTE phone.I am writing this review after year of owning this phone and I have to say I am still totally happy with it. I have to stifle the impulse to say I am amazed at the quality and usefulness of this device.I bought it with Android 5.0 1 and recently it updated - 6.01. I didn't know it would do that! It was a bonus.My only problem is the 16 gigabytes. The Android operating system does not use the SD card efficiently, and so I had problems with filling your memory with too many apps and data. This is not a problem with the phone but more a problem with the operating system. Although if the phone has more memory that would have been a solution for me.This phone has been a joy for me and I would recommend to anyone! p
Love it it's amazing the only negative so far is if you try and do too much at once it will freeze but that's expected p
Didn't get my SIM removal tool but used an earring. Other than that it's a great phone. p
Solid phone after 24 hours. It gets the job done with no software hiccups. It looks better in hand than in photos. p
Love this phone. Excellent battery life. Really good front camera. Great operating system.I would change a little the rear camera. It's good but take too long to stabalize and not take blurry photos.In general I would really recommend it for the price. p
After using the phone for about 9 months, the phone started to have shut off and started problem. Since it is under warranty, I sent it back and have it fixed. After 2 months, my phone was freezing on me. I need to send in and have it fixed again before the warranty expires. When I searched the web, it is a common problem of this phone. I will not recommend this phone. n
Iâ€™ll cut to the chase â€“ the reason Iâ€™m giving this phone 2 stars is because I consistently am having problems with calls where the call is going fine initially then all of the sudden I can hear the other person but they cannot hear me. It happens very often and frequently at my house. I have a Lumia that will take the SIM card and work â€“ when I put the SIM in that phone and use it I have absolutely ZERO issues with calls. Iâ€™ve tried contacting Alcatel support by emailing their support (have been waiting a week without response) and Iâ€™ve also tried calling. When I call I sit on hold for about 15 minutes (did it from work where my phone shows the time of the call) before I give up and hang up. Iâ€™m shopping for a new phone now because of it which sucks because it means I pretty much threw away ~$180.00. n
way better than my Samsung phone p
Awesome phone. My first smart phone and it's been nothing but great. Not sure how I loved without a smart phone before. Easy to navigate and use. Very intuitive. p
I love this phone!!! p
The first one I got I had to send back because the LED notifications light was stuck on, even when I turn it off in the settings. Amazon sent a replacement, so all is well. I really like this phone. It operates fast enough to where I don't notice any delay, I really like the display, and I really like the minimum changes that they made to Android. I have had a few other phones in the last couple years, and I always prefer stock Android to other heavily modded UIs. I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently. I think this has to do with the lock screen being engaged or not, or possibly how long the device has been asleep. I hope they fix it in the next few p
phone is great, and awesome bang for the buck. i knew the camera wasn't great from reading reviews, but in actuality it is worse than i thought. very grainy in anything but full sunlight and even then the auto focus works about 1 out of 5 times. video shooting is a little better. if you plan on taking a lot of photos pass on the phone, otherwise it's a great phone.oh, plan on taking a lot of screen shots. volume down + power = screen shot, and when trying to turn the screen off with one hand using the power button, the volume button is placed perfectly to end up taking a screen shot!UPDATE: Alcatel really supports this phone, they have done 3 software updates so far, and the camera is now performing much better. Vary happy that they are putting in effort to support the handset p
First cell I got and the two-tap on/off feature didn't work. I bought new one and am returning that defective one for refund. Are the boxes supposed to be sealed with plastic wrap because the second phone I got wasn't wrapped in plastic,... Forgot if the first one was. Great speaker and screen. I first bought an Asus zenfone 2 but returned that because the speaker and screen were incredibly bad. Idol 3 totally beats in those respects. Will update over time.Update 7-11-15.I returned first idol 3 and got replacement because double tap didn't work. And now on the replacement, double tap still barely works. It taps off but doesn't always tap back on. This is the reason i returned the first phone. I can't be only one having this issue. Other than that, good phone for now.***update 9-13-15***After months of use, I'm returning for galaxy s4. Thanks amazon for letting me. The idol, as much as I wanted to like and keep, is too slow and laggy and is sometimes unresponsive. Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in. My new s4 has a removeable battery.The things I liked were speakers in front and screen, but the slowness and unresponsive nature of device made me switch. n
It is great!!! p
Loved it!Sadly mine was defective, and had to go back. Great feel, screen, battery. Would buy again!!! p
Ok so a lot of people have the following needs for a phone: using email, web browsing, listening to music, texting/making calls, casual game playing. A lot of those people buy $700 phones to just meet those needs. The alcatel idol 3 is a fraction of that cost without any compromises in those areas. It looks feels and sounds like a classy flagship. It doesnt have the tech horse power of a 700 dollar phone, meaning if you do a lot of multitasking and high-end gaming then this probably isnt your best choice. But iv seen a lot of people mention minor lag and i can say: in terms of basic normal use there is no lag what so ever. If youre looking for something that can dazzle on a budget for the average user, this will deliver. I do wonder about the durability in the long run. The screen sits on top of the device in a way that makes me think its probably not the hardest thing to break. If youre a person that likes to go case-less, i would probably consider going with a case here. But so far i have no reasons to complain. This is a cool phone, and when you factor in the price, its a really cool phone. p
I won't rehash what's already been said about this phone. Overall I think it's a good package for the price. Three problems I have which may warrant its return are the fact that I can't get a LTE Signal on StraightTalk (AT&T Network - could be SIM card related; still investigating), can't get it to pair with my 2012 Ford F-150 Sync System (non-touch screen version) and can't get the swipe function on the keyboard to work. A vivid, bright screen, decent speakers and low price can't make up for basic functionality I rely on everyday. I'll mess around with it some more but will likely return if I can't get these features to work. I'm coming from a Google/LG Nexus 4 that took a bath in a lake and I'm missing that phone already. I do find the Idol 3 to have more lag than my Nexus 4, which was running KitKat, not Lollipop.Update: Turned out that the Bluetooth pairing problem was on the Sync end. Following a master reset of Sync the phone paired effortlessly for both phone and media audio. Haven't tried text to speech yet though. I downloaded the Google Keyboard app and swipe function has been restored. Apparently it is a well documented issue that the stock keyboard app doesn't support swipe gestures. I've upped the review to 4-stars. A little more processing performance & less lag would garner a 5 star rating. p
No issues p
Awsome budget phone just a little laggy but overall great p
1. screen is large and bright2. voice/sound is clear3. battery lasts a long time. p
So far I am loving this phone. Can't find anything bad to say. p
Great price and phone works great!! p
No Chinese support!! This is a phone made from Chinese brand!! Why???? this should be inlcuded on lroduct description!!! ...Otherwise very nice phone. n
This is a decent budget phone however the screen is very easy to break. Once it breaks it will keep randomly tapping places on your screen. The description talks about a two year warranty so hopefully that will be honored. n
I am not sure I am keeping it. The camera is great but the functionality is just awkward. The phone turn off by itself. I am using map my run to record my runs and the phone just turned off and this happened all the time I use it to record my workout. The good thing about this phone is probably the camera and the charge. It hold the charge pretty good, with all the apps on it and video call,I manage to stay away from the charger for 2 full days. I kept it for a week now but i am returning it.Just to update my rating, so i live in an apt on 10th floor and I can't get a fair signal, when outside I get the 4G LTE signal ,then at my work I get H+ what ever that is and of course I have no service in the basement. From different places, the signal jump and the Bluetooth is on and off in my car and sometimes I am on the phone and all is just blank, nothing I can still see the signal strength either H+ or 4G LTE.I default storage for picture and video to SD card and that is not working, I have to manually do that and clear the phone memory which is already used with all the apps. Definitely, the phone is going back I am not sure which phone to buy on budget. n
excellent p
worked great for me in St Lucia. with a World Travel SIM card. p
Item as described. p
It's affordable and looks great which is what I needed.However it freezes up a lot and I'm on my second one.If you need something affordable, get it.I must warn you though I have to return my second one because it's going crazy and Amazon almost didn't let me return it because it is out of the return window. It's cute and it works okay but the bad kind of outweighs the good. If you can avoid it and purchase a Samsung or something then I would suggest doing that. I paid 220 for it and now it's 250...no. n
After less than 2 month of use, i'm having dead spots right in the middle of the screen. n
So first phone I received had some problems, but they were very cooperative at getting me a new one and I got it very fast. This phone has blown me away with what you get with the price. The audio is amazing its up there with the HTC one m8 in my opinion. Only complaint I have is that the original one I recieveced had very nice jbl headphones, and the second one had much cheaper headphones. That doesn't concern the phone but that was quite the disappointment. Had the phone for several months now and I still hold it in the highest regard. Blows the HTC one I had before this, out of the water in every way. And now its 30$ cheaper then when I got it. Even more of a steal. p
This thing is awesome. The battery life is great, i get 4-5 hours of screen on time with half brightness which is great because the speakers cannot be beaten at this price point. They sure beat my old HTC One M7 boom sound speakers. I bought this phone and a case along with a 64 gig Sandisk memory card all under 280 dollars. I like to watch a lot of media so the beautiful big screen and dual front facing speakers is was sold me. The camera is not the best in the world, but more than enough for social media. You can take some real nice shots with it. All in all its a great phone! p
So far, so good! p
The size is perfect for average guy. It's large enough for typing w/ 2 thumbs, and small enough for use w/ one hand.The phone is light. So it doesn't bounce around in pants pocket.The battery life is good for a lite user. With cell data mostly off, I typically get 3-4 days.The case design allows secure fit for the soft shell, while exposing the forward facing speakers. Make sure to get a shell, or it might not survive a drop.The only downside is the SD card. It is in the same tray as the Sim card. When I take it out to transfer large files, sometimes it takes a few tries to get both cards aligned when inserting. p
Alcatel Onetouch Idol 3 5.5 has certainly done right this time. The phone can't compete with the top flagship phones today, but for its price, you can't really complain. Phone is nicely designed and it is almost as thin as a iphone 6+. Phone has a beautiful display and loud speakers that you can compete with the flagship phones today. That's where the difference ends. It has a slower snapdragon 615 cpu 2gigs of memory, no removable battery, nfc and wireless/quick charge. One design quirk that I don't like is the placement of the power and volume rocker. Most phones has power button to the right and volume rockers to the left, this is just the opposite. Not to mention that the power button is so high up in the phone. The phone looks nice but not very well protected so you should definitely get a case for it. Software is Lollipop 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 that other flagship offers. Although I can't complain about the almost stock android experience which works fine for me. You definitely need a micro sd card if you want to put movies and mp3's as I only have 7 gigs free without having any media files stored internally. I hope that Alcatel can offer software updates like what the other flagship phones does.Should you get this phone, yes, but I would wait for Alcatel phone goes on sale as I brought mine for less than $200.Pro's- Has a beautiful 1080p display.- Very nice stereo speakers- FM tuner- Band 12 LTE for t-mobile phones- Nice, nice and thin design while maintaining a 2915 mah battery.Cons- Placement of power and volume rockers- Slower Snapdragon 615 cpu with 2 gigs of memory.- No NFC, wireless and quick charging- Android 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 p
korea KT 3G data speed not good.... p
well love the phone just wish some one would come up with a battery case for it, maybe one with wireless charging. it seems like a no brainer for all these phablets. p
working fine. It is totally surprise.. Never thought such kind of performance ... Only issues with low light picture.. p
What are u waiting for its ether between this or the moto g p
Coming from a nexus 5, this was definitely a good upgrade. The screen is just amazing, the best screen I've seen on a phone. It's vibrant and bright (even in bright sunlight). I really hope the next version has more RAM and a better camera. The current camera is good but nothing to write home about. It's definitely better than the nexus 5 (2013) and the moto g and it's not fair to compare it to flagship phones. The speakers are ridiculously good (stereo too!!). It comes with JBL headsets, which are way better than the other standard headsets you get these days (if you're lucky to get one that is). The screen size is great. The next model should definitely have quick charge, a bigger battery (even though the current one lasts almost 12 hours on medium-high use and at 70% brightness, this includes watching videos, listening to music a lot and reading articles every hour). The SD card is a huge advantage, seriously this phone is a winner. Also, the most important part, it's pretty much stock Android!!! Which is really the star of the show here. Would recommend this to anyone interested in a good phone. p
Excelent cell and Good price p
i like the phone weight and speakers its one of the best available in this price ranger p
Great phone for price! Nice big 5.5 inch full HD display.Nearly stock android. Dual front speakers is a plus! p
Good Price and Good phone! p
Pluses:Price: about $100 (can't believe this much phone for the money)Display: 1080P while it's not AMOLED, really pretty for the $Sound: stereo speakers rock. Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop "full battery" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users. p
Luv luv luv my phone p
Using at&t go phone sim...operates 6.01 marshmellow ...more than enough phone. I', in the boonies and gets reception. p
The screen is very bright and sharp but not as colorful as a Super AMOLED screen. The speakers are very loud and clear. compared to others. There is processor lag when overloaded with tasks. I don't mind not having a fingerprint sensor because this is a mid range phone after all. Camera is pretty good. I prefer polished aluminum but the design of this plastic phone is very beautiful. Good durability in my opinion when properly cased AND screen protected of coarse. Has survived many drops from my kiddos. The user interface is almost stock Android, very easy to navigate. This is a perfect starter phone for a younger adolescent,older adult or daily user on the go. p
Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation. p
Phone came in perfect conditions, fast shipping, it's a game changer, best phone for his price, specs, screen, batery.Just one thign it's that lag in his original Android 5.0, update after purchased to marshmallow y voila u have a awesome flashkiller p
I just got it today. I installed all of my apps and tested it out.Pros:CheapStylishSound qualityVideosCons:Not as fast as I thought it would beTerrible mic/recordingTerrible with popular apps such as snapchat/instagramCamera quality goes significantly down if you zoom inOnce in awhile it will stop detecting the sim cardI have been using this phone since June 2015. Now I am going to back to the flagship phone...learned my lesson. n
I will start by saying that I buy the majority of my electronics and phones from Amazon because I'm too lazy to do research for the best possible price. With that being said I literally stumbled upon the Idol 3 pre-order page and said what the heck. 199.99 what could I lose. Well last week when I received it I was stunned by what I got. This phone specs may not be jaw dropping but the way it's all put together is amazing. The signal reception is great. The camera is great. The app load times is great. Overall you cannot go wrong by giving Alcatel a try on this one. Sure they make budget phones but this in my opinion is far from a budget phone. I have a weekly rotation of phones I use but this has been one of my daily drivers for 2 weeks. p
Pro's1. very well built.2. speakers better then expected, JBL earbuds that came with the phone are great.3. chargers very quickly.4. camera is good, not poor, not great, just good, will be testing some more, will re-post here soon.5. very little to no lag for me, every user is different. I text, make calls, email, pictures of my kids, no games. again every user experience will vary. again NO LAG!!! for me.6. the price THE PRICE. $249.00.7. better then my oneplus one, experience. leaps and bounds.8. bright notification light9. very light10. the screen is really really bright, hands on of the brightest screens i have ever used. example my iphone 6 plus at 50%, my nokia 930 at 70%, my note 3 at 55%, my lg g3 at 75%, the phone i have at 25% again 25%11. the price lol $249!!! again $249!!purchase this phone and see and experience for yourselves, and remember you can always send it back if you are not satisfied.. that's the beauty of purchasing from amazon.will come back in one to two weeks, will see if my rating of 5 stars stays or changes.Update 6/10/2015Okay LTE speeds on AT&T are great at least in my area.Camera I would compare to the nexus 5, with nexus 5 slightly better.Lag, yes when lots of apps are running. Not to bad for a mid range phone.Screen very good, though it does kill the battery life pretty quick, and I have it at 30%.brightness.Battery life lasting about a day and a half with moderate use, social media, texting, emails, calls. Build quality doesn't worry me to much right now. No creeks. For 250 definitely a worthy backup, but flagship? no.update6/15/2015battery life just kept on getting worse, turned off location GPS, sync, and all apps in the background, standby time kept on taking a hit. biggest culprit was the screen it self. one full charge would only last me a about 20 hours, not even a whole day.and proximity sensor stopped working. just glad it happened with in the return period. n
I think that some of them defective and I just got one of the defective onesVery slowBad signalScreen colors look fadedBluetooth week signalNot always switch between landscapes to portraitThe good about the one I have is the speakersAnd the battery lifeYou can't exchange only Send it back and get ur money back which in my case its 199 when new one cost 249 n
Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out. n
Nice smartphone p
for 250 this phone is pretty good i wanted to buy an unlocked phone that i can use with any gsm carrier i feel i made the right choice with this, coming from an iphone 6 plus you can tell its a little slower when browsing the web but the rest is fine with me i also love that i can extend my memory with an sd card, i am also happy this has lte im paying $35 A MONTH now for unl talk n text and 2gb of LTE cant beat that p
I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I donâ€™t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wifeâ€™s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (Iâ€™m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wifeâ€™s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my â€œmediumâ€ sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of appâ€™s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phoneâ€™s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to "boost" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there. p
What can I say?Great phone. Loud speakers, good camera, stock google lollipop!Great battery life!Bright screen, and processor barely shows its budget price.If you want a phone for 250, this is the best option for ya. Best all around phone at this price. p
Great phone but it came with a couple of dead pixels right in the center of the screen. I've never run into dead pixels on a phone before. Returned and waiting for another. n
This phone is a great phone that never seems to have a problem. It is very conformable in my hand. i have had it freeze 1 time but it was only for a couple of seconds and during a software update. p
Quite a fantastic phone for a reasonable price! p
This phone was OK at best. The amount of lag in its build of android was pretty bad. Security patches hadn't been released for it since June of 2016. Luckily I only needed it to last me a month so I could replace it. Sadly, even at that requirement it took just the right spill on Halloween and the screen cracked. So much for making it a play phone for my son. n
nice features p
Very good p
I purchased this phone only recently here on Amazon and paid $99 - but it is now listed @ $240. And so you might think I would be delighted that I got such a 'good' deal, right? WRONG. I am extremely disappointed with this phone, despite my previous research and finding many good reviews on it.I have an LG41C with no special bells and whistles, though it pretty much has everything I really need. But after almost two years, it's got a couple of glitches that can't be resolved so I thought I would "upgrade" to another brand and a larger size. What a mistake!This Alcatel takes 45 + seconds to start fully (my LG takes 20), it takes only adequate photos (my LG takes GREAT pics), the battery runs almost out after only a few hours of little to no usage and with power save on - plus I haven't even talked on this phone yet! (my LG runs hours longer and I occasionally talk on it), and this Alcatel takes HOURS to fully charge (my LG takes an hour at most and that's if it's under 10%). AND while it's charging (power off) it makes a low buzzing sound about every 15 seconds and there is NO way to stop it.In addtion to all that - I cannot open photos on messaging and despite confirming that all the settings are correct. I tried everything possible and then called Alcatel and was actually told that the messaging that is built into this phone is not the best and you can't receive MMS! What? My LG has always opened photos via its built-in messaging, as long as mobile data is enabled. So the Alcatel rep told me to use another messaging app in order to open photos. Unacceptable.And not only all that, it will NOT sound a notification upon receipt of text messages. Again, I have worked with all the appropriate settings (I'm not a novice) over and over and it simply will not work.Also, there are no emojis available on the keypad when you're using Instagram. Huh?I've no doubt there are multiple other problems with this phone that I've never even encountered yet - but in the two weeks that I've used it, these are quite enough problems.And now . . . this is the worst:In the past couple of days, this Alcatel gets VERY HOT during charging (my LG NEVER gets hot when charging, not even in the slightest) - and this heating issue alone is why I am going to send it back because I fear it is potentially dangerous. A phone simply should NOT get this hot while charging.Everyone has their own opinion and can make their own decision - but I would NOT recommend this phone to anyone and I am appalled that this $99 phone (not even worth that) is NOW listed at such a ridiculous price of $240. n
Screen is not scratch resistant..used it for a month and already screen got numerous scratches.. n
OK not the best not the worst p
Freezes often and loads apps very slowly. n
This is an amazing phone for the price. We have two kids and want them both to have a phone for when they leave the house. They are also both huge gamers when allowed and this phone keeps up with them! The screen is beautiful and the sound is incredible. My daughter is a music lover so she's always streaming music from hers and I can hear it from all over the house when she has it turned up - with her door closed. I love that this phone offers everything a high end phone does for a fraction of the price. My husband actually is thinking of getting rid of his current phone to get one of these and he's a phone nerd. It comes with the phone, wall plug in and cable and some very nice jbl headphones that sound amazing! Cases and screen protectors are not hard to find for this phone which is nice. The last phone they had we couldn't find anything. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great device at a low cost. Shipping was fast and it was packaged nice. p
I wouldn't recommend this phone. Very poor battery life. Not very compatible with Ultra mobile. Lots of glitches. Should have known better just gonna stick with my nexus5 very fast and reliable. Don't waste your moneyon this phone. n
This is a very good phone though there are things to improve.The dual front-facing stereo speakers are super awesome which is very hard to find on other phones. The display is very amazing as well.My idol 3 5.5' is extremely good when playing videos. I love watching movie trailers and YouTube videos on it.My standard of choosing smartphones:1. At least 2GB RAM, CPU really doesn't matter to me2. 1080p or higher display resolution3. Display is larger than 5.0 inches4. Dual frontal stereo speakers5. Good product quality6. At least a 3000mAh bettary7. Expandable storage or a 64GB storage with a reasonable price8. Quick charger availableWhat I don't like about my idol 3:1. The JBL earbuds are those deep in-ear type which I don't like at all. It feels very uncomfortable to me to put anything deep inside of my ears. I know those deep in-ear headphones are very popular right now, but I really don't like them. This is not a big issue since I have earbuds from Apple and Motorola and I usually use my AKG and Sony headbands to listen to music.2. There is a lag sometimes while using the phone. This is not a big problem except when playing music which really bothers me. I hope it is a software issue, but I didn't have that problem with my Moto X 2 Gen.Considering the price, idol 3 5.5' really is a very good choice! p
If you get this phone, be very very careful with it.I purchased this phone right when it came out in the U.S., pre-ordering it on Amazon. Overall, I found it to be a great deal. The screen and battery life were great, the processor snappy, and the camera good for the price range.Unfortunately, after 6 months, I pulled my Alcatel Idol 3 out of my pocket and the screen was cracked. It had not been struck by anything, as you can see from the photo below. The crack comes from the edge, and there is no physical damage there. When I called Alcatel and they told me the warranty does not cover 'physical damage' and that a cracked screen counts as 'physical damage' no matter what.Maybe my phone was defective an Alcatel simply didn't want to cover my warranty. Otherwise, I gotta say, ONLY BUY THIS PHONE IF YOU PLAN TO BE VERY GENTLE WITH IT!!! (I had mine in a protective case).I ended up with a Moto G 3. It isn't quite as good as the Alcatel Idol 3 as far as screen goes, but what is the use of a phone that is slightly better if it is liable to break and Alcatel won't cover it? It is not worth the $200+ dollar risk.Again, hopefully for others, my phone was just defective. n
Awesome. p
Touch screen stopped responding on the bottom 1/4 inch of the screen. This sucks as it is where all of the navigation buttons are. This phone is almost bran new, never dropped. Tried factory reset - no luck. Phone is now useless after 60 or so days. n
Excelent! p
My daughter loved it. p
Now, this is a nice phone. Nice, clear screen. At 5.5 inches, it is definitely larger than my previous Moto G 2013, so it took a little getting used to. Hands are small so not all that easy for one handed use with my case. Love the speakers up front. Makes watching my shows on Netfilx that much more enjoyable. The UI is a little laggy at times, but that is compared to almost stock android on the Moto G. Compared to a friend's Samsung with TouchWiz, I get just a few less hangs up. The camera works for me (again, coming from that Moto G), but I have used much better (that Note 4 cam, wow!). I am truly impressed and would recommend it easily. p
It's a good for the price tag. I really liked the battery life and all other aspect. The screen design makes it difficult to recommend this phone. Thin phone + 5.5 display is prone to CRACK!!! My idol3 screen cracked in regular usage and I'm no longer able to use the phone. n
I am never one to write negative reviews but if I could give this piece of garbage a negative star rating I would. Please do not trust any of these reviews people. This garbage phone cant even handle the snapchat app. It repeatedly crashed and restarted because it couldn't even process a snapchat video and the audio from any video recording is laughably bad. Returned this and got a refurbished G3 for cheaper which blows this phone AWAY IN EVERY POSSIBLE CATEGORY AND FUNCTIONALITY. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!! n
Great phone, but only have had it for 2 weeks. No complaints, working great with whatever I throw at it. I like it a lot so far. p
Great phone! Worth every penny!Update.....After having the phone six months, it stopped working randomly one day. I tried plugging it into a charger and the only thing it would do was power cycle itself continuously. I reached out to Alcatel via e mail to no avail.I decided to send one last e mail threatening a report to the Better Business Bureau and I magically received 4 e mails in response from4 different people. Huh.....Long story short, they paid to ship the phone back to them to get fixed and it turns out they couldn't, so they have me a new one at no cost.It took a bit but they made right in the end. p
Good on paper only. Bad software and bad support. Do not buy this "smart" phone if you value listening to music.Initially google voice did not work. Then now bluetooth music stutters. Headphones music hiccups occasionally.Support for this phone is substandard. They will ask you to ship your phone and wait for a refurb or repaired phone for 2 weeks. n
Great phone. Excellent relationship quality:price p
Love it best budget phone to have around p
Awesome phone great for a $250 phone p
Good phone. Speaker is made for R&B Though. Metalheads beware p
Wow just WOW p
I purchased this after reading great reviews and I couldn't be more satisfied for the price. This phone's sound is unbelievable, and the screen is every bit as good as my Galaxy S4. Very lightweight for the large size. Love that I can add/change memory card via a pop-out tray on the side. One potential drawback for heavy phone users is nonremovable batter, but great for average phone use, music, podcasts and video. Good camera with plenty of options, too. Unlike some lower-priced phones, has latest version of Lollipop. p
The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it). p
Perfect out of the box. I like the little device that ejects the sim card. Great camera. All the best to offer in an Android phone. p
the item i received was in good shape, but a fake earpod were provided inside the box. keep that in mind n
Let me first list the best things about this phone:- Excellent speakers and superb screen, it is a joy to watch music videos and movies on this phone- Lot of value for the money- Thin, really good looking phoneThe bad/not so good points:- Way too slippery and without gorilla glass I am sure my screen would have shattered with regular use, ended up buying a wallet case and now I have a bulky phone- Not the best processing power, I face occasional lags especially after Marshmallow update. I wouldn't have mentioned this as a negative point considering the phone price point but I have a Blu phone that cost less than this phone and that phone is much faster.In short if you are looking for a phone with good stereo speakers and nice display but don't mind putting a screen protector and a bulky case for the phone, this would be a good fit. But if you are looking to use the phone without any protective case then this may not be the right phone since I am pretty sure the phone screen will break with regular use. n
I've had this phone for a couple of days now; I wanted something with a bigger screen, but without having to spend the eight or nine hundred bucks it would have cost to stay in the iPhone family. My overall cost for this phone and a 64 GB microSD card was about 1/4 the cost of an iPhone 6S Plus.Getting the phone set up was mostly simpleâ€”I checked for and installed the Android system updates while charging the phone, then put in the microSD and SIM cards. (The SIM card was kind of a pain, since an adapter was necessary, but once I discovered that the adapter I ordered did include a thin strip of tape to make sure the SIM card doesn't fall out (which was not mentioned anywhere on the package), all went smoothly.)The parts I like, so far:â€¢ the expandable storage/memory. I may replace the 64 GB card with a 128 GB card at some point, but it'll be more than enough for now. I'm just happy to no longer be limited to the phone's built-in storage.â€¢ the large screen and full HD (1080 x 1920) resolution. Text is very readable, even at the "normal" setting, and there's plenty of room for whatever I'm looking at. Images generally look sharp and smooth, without jagginess.â€¢ the "double tap" feature. Double tap to wake the phone, then double tap to put it to sleep again. Very convenientâ€”especially given the phone's reversible feature. Caveat: it does not work with the lock screen. In that instance, the power button has to be used to put the phone back to sleep.â€¢ the reversible feature. I'm surprised more phones don't do this. When the feature is enabled, the display orients itself to the way you are holding the phone. Not only that, but the earpiece and microphones switch as well, so the phone is always right side up, even when holding it upside down.â€¢ the battery life. So far, the battery life seems very good. The phone did charge a little bit between the time I transferred some photos to my computer and the time I unplugged the USB cable; otherwise, the battery is currently at 39% since its first full charge two nights ago.â€¢ the "sweep" feature (or whatever it is called), which enables you to close all open apps at once. Very convenient.â€¢ the phone is light. Despite being significantly larger than my old iPhone 5 (the display on this phone by itself is bigger than the iPhone 5 in a case), the Idol 3 is lighter than the iPhone 5. I don't think it's a huge difference, but it's definitely enough to notice.â€¢ the stereo speakers. The speakers sound goodâ€”and they sound just as good whether the phone is facing up or down (even in the simple case I bought for it).â€¢ the unlocked phone is upgradable to Marshmallow 6.0.1. (My carrier offers the Idol 3, but there's no indication of the Marshmallow upgrade being available from them anytime soon. Otherwise, I would have gone through them.)There are a couple of things I'm not so keen on at the moment:â€¢ the placement of the buttons. Though on opposite sides, the power and volume buttons are placed at about the same level; I have already taken several inadvertent screenshots while trying to put the phone to sleep from the lock screen.â€¢ the camera. It may be a matter of getting used to it, but the camera does not appear to live up to the quality of the display. Colors seem a bit washed out, especially with the front camera. Also, the front camera offers only automatic exposure, whereas the back camera offers full manual. UPDATE (8/20/16): The manual mode is useless. You can adjust ISO, shutter speed, and focus (!), but all you'll get is a black imageâ€”yup, no picture whatsoever. Only the automatic exposure mode will work. In addition, the panoramic mode does a poor job; you WILL end up with jagged edges at the least, and probably even sections where the image is not stitched together properly. In any event, in all but the best lighting conditions, your images will be noisy, with some blockiness apparent, and plenty of chroma noise. If you already have a phone that takes decent photos, you'll want to hang onto it; either that, or use a real camera.â€¢ if you use a PIN to unlock your phone, Android requires you to press a "check" key after the number. Not a huge deal, but iOS unlocks the phone as soon as you've pressed that last digit, so I sometimes forget, and the phone goes back to sleep.â€¢ unlike the iPhone, this phone doesn't read the SIM card until after the rather lengthy splash screen animation has finished. So, whereas the iPhone will show the name of the carrier and signal strength as soon as you've unlocked the phone, the Idol 3 shows "No SIM Card", and then "No SIM Card â€“ [carrier]" before the name of the carrier appears. This always gives me pause, particularly since I have a nano SIM and had to use an adapter. Also unlike the iPhone, the display does not show the name of the carrier all the timeâ€”but that can be easily verified in the Quick Setting panel. (I mean, I know who my carrier is; I just like to know that the telephony function of the phone is working properly.)As for the quality of phone calls, I haven't used it long enough, but the first call I made sounded okay. At this point, I would probably give the iPhone a slight edge in sound quality.I haven't tried the earbuds yet, but then I rarely use my phone to listen to music, so this isn't much of a concern for me.(A note about the packaging: because they've hidden it under the lid covering the compartments of the box that contain the USB cable, charger, and earbuds, the tool used to open the card holder is very easy to miss. I had already used the one that came with the SIM card adapter I bought at the same time as the phone when I finally noticed it was there.)Apart from a few hiccups that go with getting used to a new OS, I am liking the Idol 3 so far. It's a light phone with a great display, good sound, and good battery life, and I didn't have to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get it. n
Phone came on time. The package was not damaged what-so-ever. The phone is an remarkable. The design is elegant, the hardware can manage and overcome everything that the phone has to offer (Android Marshmallow running as smooth as on a flagship). The Screen is bright and pretty - all colors stand out and the HD display proves its amazing.Under $200, this is an amazing smartphone, and one would expect it to cost at least under $400. No problems yet, I have been using it for a week, and the phone performs well over 5 stars! p
the phone is good, it updated to android 6 as soon as i activated it with my carrier. the only downside is the camera which is kinda crappy. p
I cannot compare this Smartphone to any other product because this is the only smart phone I've ever had.I bought it a year ago because it was unlocked and I could use my Tracfone Account and because of its many features so that I could use it for virtual reality, gaming and 4G LTE phone.I am writing this review after year of owning this phone and I have to say I am still totally happy with it. I have to stifle the impulse to say I am amazed at the quality and usefulness of this device.I bought it with Android 5.0 1 and recently it updated - 6.01. I didn't know it would do that! It was a bonus.My only problem is the 16 gigabytes. The Android operating system does not use the SD card efficiently, and so I had problems with filling your memory with too many apps and data. This is not a problem with the phone but more a problem with the operating system. Although if the phone has more memory that would have been a solution for me.This phone has been a joy for me and I would recommend to anyone! p
Love it it's amazing the only negative so far is if you try and do too much at once it will freeze but that's expected p
Didn't get my SIM removal tool but used an earring. Other than that it's a great phone. p
Solid phone after 24 hours. It gets the job done with no software hiccups. It looks better in hand than in photos. p
awesome phone. better than i expected. great screen. great speakers and headphones p
I says to myself, if I spend $600 plus for a phone, I would always worry about dropping it, leaving it somewhere, spilling coffee on it, etc. For $249.00 bucks I got a beautiful bright high quality screen, very good stereo speakers, great build quality,a reversible display,a decent camera, great battery life, Android 5.0.2 and expandable memory! I mean we talking $249.00 bucks! What is the logic in listening to speakers on the back or side of a phone? Who in their right mind would even consider saying anything negative about spending $249.00 bucks for a phone that does more than 90% of the phones on the market for less than half the price! Still hard to believe I got all this for $249.00 bucks! Watching videos with the stereo speakers is the main feature that sets this phone apart from the rest of the phones on the market. Best purchase I every made! p
Great phone for price. Alcatel surprised me p
Had this phone for one week. It is amazing. But please understand this is my first smart phone, but I've been studying them for years. I just could not accept the usual contract and fees. Ugh. I'm glad I waited. Great price. Fabulous GSM service. Allowed me to walk into ATT store, get a free SIM card and $45.00 a month, unlimited text and talk, 1.5GB data. Plenty for me. Added a 64 GB SD card. Phone now has 80GB of storage. And despite what some have said, the processor never bogged down for all the things I am doing. I call it the poor man's iPhone 6+. And the screen is as bright as any 700.00 dollar phone. I'd recommend it. p
Love the new phone. The camera is great! p
Bought this phone for my wife and she loves it. p
Do not buy this phone unless you want a phone that last 3 months the glue they used to attach the screen has weared off in 3 months so the screen is litlery pealing off my phone at this moment do not buy n
I can never seem to settle on a phone. I splurge on the latest new device, only to regret it for some reason or another. Sold my Moto G because the camera was terrible, sold my Note 4 because I think having a $700 phone is ridiculous.Wanted LTE band 12 (T-Mobile is building out their network coverage in rural areas especially with this frequency not supported yet by many phones), a big screen, dual band WiFi, and a price under $300.Initially passed over this phone and Alcatel altogether because it seemed like a very low end brand. This device has changed my opinion of the company. I also looked at the zte zmax and huawei p8 lite, but this Idol 3 seemed to be the best combination of affordability and features.Very customizable and near stock Android lollipop. Great screen, great speakers, decent build quality, decent main camera (seems about as good as my old S4 which was fine), above average front facing camera. Too bad it doesnt have a replaceable battery, but not a huge deal. Doesnt seem like an octa core processor, lagging at times, although not enough to annoy.I usually install custom software on my phones, but after using this phone for a while, turning off double tap to wake, and uninstalling almost all of the preinstalled apps, I like it the way it is.Because it was cheap for a smartphone, I won't be devastated if it gets dropped or cracked. Turn off double tap to wake, uninstall unwanted apps, install a different launcher if you want, install Google keyboard, be careful installing the sim card, dont expect it to behave like a $700 Note 4, and enjoy! p
For the money I think this is a pretty good phone. Screen is clear but not as good as I expected. Battery life is good. Speakers are very good and surprisingly loud and clear if needed. The one thing that really bugged me was the call quality. Not sure how I sounded to others but on my end voice quality sounded hollow and tinny and whatever I was listening to kept fading in and out. Pretty sure it was the phone because my cheaper back-up phone doesn't have those issues. I eventually decided to return the phone for a refund. I think a better choice, in the same price range, would be the Huawei Ascend Mate 2. Bigger screen and killer battery life. For something cheaper go with BLU. p
I have been using this phone for over a month now. This phone is not a crap filled phone. It is perfect. Battery last long time. Screen is crisp and bright. Does not feel like a cheap phone in the hand. Front dual speakers are excellent and the JBL headphones are a super bonus. Phone is very responsive. My only negative issue is the tap on tap off feature that is a little quirky, but turn this feature off and its a great phone for a great price!!! p
I had for a couple of weeks with no problem. but then one day the just stop working it wont even let get into the homepage. I had to return it back. this that bs. n
If you read through these reviews, you will notice that most are from people who have just purchased the phone. At first flush, the OneTouch Idol 3 is an amazing phone. It's a beautiful phone, and it's internal components are first-rate. I never had better speeds on the T-Mobile network. It seems like a great phone, and the price cannot be beat for what you get.However, this is a one star review for a reason. The phone has one dramatic flaw is only noticeable after a few months of ownership. And it's a flaw that renders the phone unusable. To keep the price down, Alcatel did not use Gorilla Glass for the big and beautiful screen. It's probably how they kept the price of this phone so low. This and this alone is a reason to look elsewhere for your next phone. All it takes is a small drop or accidentally sitting on the phone to crack the glass. And it doesn't just crack, it shatters like a window pane.The glass will shatter even if you have the phone in a hard case, which is what happened to me (twice, with two different phones). Sadly, this is a known issue and Alcatel will not replace your phone, even under warranty. n
Not bad given the price .. But if u r coming from a high end device to this .. U will surely feel the performance hit .. This phones performance is very sluggish .. p
Great device ... It's better than I expected !!!Great performance at low price ... u won't get that ultra mega performance like new flagships .. But u will get %80 of their performance at a fraction of their price !! It's a good deal :) p
Software and screen were lovely until the phone started to not display anything but colored lines. I wanted to like this phone and am really annoyed it broke within 48 hrs. No drops no wetness. I would get a replacement but I'm not a believer in the brand anymore n
Sending it back. Would not boot into Android after downloading the update that I was prompted to do. n
Great display and sound, beautiful look p
This phone is great! I hadn't had any real problems out of it except for when it did not wake up at one time. I tapped, I pressed the power button and I even called it, mind you this was after the most recent update. I ended up having to do a hard reset on it, so far no further problems. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't have access to emojis on social media but other than its a very good phone definitely worth $250 bucks.UPDATE!!!!!!!Well I have had this phone for a while now and I loved it, the only problems Ive had with this phone are ones that Ive caused myself, as far as the phone messing up on its own, no problems. The worst thing about this phone is the screen is not durable at all, one tap against a chair and it cracks and the screen does not work, cant unlock it, cant do anything, my galaxy s3 is way more durable than this. I recommend getting a tempered glass protector for it and the most durable case you can, but generally as long as you have the tempered glass you can just about use any case you would like. Ive searched all over for a phone that might compare to this, tired of Samsung products and their UI and notification sounds, to poor for anything else that I might genuinely like, ran across the HONOR 5X but it doesnt have a reversible interface and it hasnt been released yet, I'm not patient enough to wait a couple months for reviews so I figure I will just order this again, Win WIn. p
love it. p
Great performance, never run into any lagging. Nice and thin and fits well in my pocket (I was used to a 4" phone!). Great screen and battery life. Dropped one star because the camera isn't all that great, particularly in low light. p
Amazing Phone at a very affordable price. Highly recommend! p
A great Android phone. A quality purchase at a very good price. p
I'm just giving 3 stars for now as I still don't know if the phone works good or not.The phone arrived on time but when I put in my Metro PCS SIM card it won't recognize it.I checked on the website and it clearly states that phone is compatible with AT&T,T-Mobile,Metro PCS and most GSM carriers.I will go to the Metro PCS store tomorrow to see if there's a way get it to work.UPDATED REVIEW!!!!!,,,I went to Metro PCS to get a newer SIM card and this time it worked,had to pay an extra $15 but the phone is running and is working properly.I think the price is ok for a phone like this.The phone is thin and it looks like is well constructed,the only weird thing is that the power button is on the upper left side but I can live with that.The screen isn't too bright but I can also live with that and for a phone with a 5.5 screen is not bulky or too big,I just love the size and I'm happy with my phone.WELL I'M GIVING THE PHONE 4 STARS!!!!!! n
Feels like my m7 just a tiny bit slower, but with all the same features and better camera. p
It's a great phone with annoying issues.What I like about the phone:Has the best display on a budget phone and can go head to head with any flagship phone.Has great speakers and audio experience. This phone sounds better than a lot of the flagships out there. The speaker and headset port produce some great sound. This phone easily competes with all the flagships in the audio category and beats if not all than most.GPS, alcatel got it right, it's so hard to find an android phone with flawless gps performance. This phone locks on in quickly and is pretty accurate, the moto g is pretty good in this regard as well. My galaxy s6 ($600 phone) has issues with gps performance.Battery: You can easily make it through the day again this beats my s6 but not as good as a note 4. For the price it beats a lot of flagships in the battery category.What I don't like (mostly software issues)Cell reception: It's worse than my old galaxy s4, s6, and note. I can easily get lte on my other phones and this phone barely gets HDSPA. Sometimes drops to edge. The download speed is slower. But what annoys me the most is when I'm in a good area and the phone sticks on hdspa and doesn't switch to lte. I noticed that this happens much more often when my radio is set to lte/wcdma/gsm more than lte/wcdma. So I have to manually switch it by going into the test settings through dial codes.Brightness: For some reason randomly the phone will dim all the way randomly, even with auto brightness turned off, me being outside, and the display set to full brightness. Which can make following directions or reading something outside very annoying.Background audio: Sometimes when I watched a youtube video put it on pause and turned off the display. Get a notification and the youtube video starts playing with the screen still off. It's annoying, and another software bug. Youtube isn't the only application to do this, for me most applications do this.Double tap: Turn it off, too many butt dials with the feature turned on.So great hardware, but there are some software issues, I'm checking for updates every day. I really want to keep this device. But my old cheaper moto g didn't have any of these issues. I think alcatel has a great device but for some reason way too many software bugs that needed to be ironed out before launch. n
I just got a Alcatel Idol 3 It didn't bring the sd card remover call Amazon they overnighted me new phone..Great job on Amazon's behalf..Now the phone doesn't play all kinds of music files as other cell phones in its catagory you would have to find or buy some program to change files to play your music. I found it to be slow,on ATT and the tap to wake doesn't work all the time sometime when you make a long distance call and try to hit speaker phone the phone goes black or you loss the call. I will try to keep several more days to see if an update is going to solve some of the issues if not Iam going back to the LG G4. I realize that you get what you pay for but not at the risk of losing calls from fam. I have tried the sam s5,Htc M one 9, Micro's 618 windows and and so far the LG G4 is the best even though speaker is not that great everthing else is.. n
The first one I got I had to send back because the LED notifications light was stuck on, even when I turn it off in the settings. Amazon sent a replacement, so all is well. I really like this phone. It operates fast enough to where I don't notice any delay, I really like the display, and I really like the minimum changes that they made to Android. I have had a few other phones in the last couple years, and I always prefer stock Android to other heavily modded UIs. I don't know why other companies think they can improve on something I am sure Google spent a lot of time developing...Pros- UI- The reversible speaker and home screen. I prefer having the headphone jack at the bottom when listening to music.- ScreenCons- My only complaint is that the double tap on feature doesn't work consistently. I think this has to do with the lock screen being engaged or not, or possibly how long the device has been asleep. I hope they fix it in the next few p
phone is great, and awesome bang for the buck. i knew the camera wasn't great from reading reviews, but in actuality it is worse than i thought. very grainy in anything but full sunlight and even then the auto focus works about 1 out of 5 times. video shooting is a little better. if you plan on taking a lot of photos pass on the phone, otherwise it's a great phone.oh, plan on taking a lot of screen shots. volume down + power = screen shot, and when trying to turn the screen off with one hand using the power button, the volume button is placed perfectly to end up taking a screen shot!UPDATE: Alcatel really supports this phone, they have done 3 software updates so far, and the camera is now performing much better. Vary happy that they are putting in effort to support the handset p
First cell I got and the two-tap on/off feature didn't work. I bought new one and am returning that defective one for refund. Are the boxes supposed to be sealed with plastic wrap because the second phone I got wasn't wrapped in plastic,... Forgot if the first one was. Great speaker and screen. I first bought an Asus zenfone 2 but returned that because the speaker and screen were incredibly bad. Idol 3 totally beats in those respects. Will update over time.Update 7-11-15.I returned first idol 3 and got replacement because double tap didn't work. And now on the replacement, double tap still barely works. It taps off but doesn't always tap back on. This is the reason i returned the first phone. I can't be only one having this issue. Other than that, good phone for now.***update 9-13-15***After months of use, I'm returning for galaxy s4. Thanks amazon for letting me. The idol, as much as I wanted to like and keep, is too slow and laggy and is sometimes unresponsive. Double tap on and off decides on its own when it wants to work, I hit call button twice sometimes because it doesn't respond the first time I try and the swype to text on the phone doesn't work well; it's as if my finger gets caught up/stuck on the screen and it doesn't make the word or forms incorrect word.Its just too slow and unresponsive for me. When I clear the screens with button on bottom right, the slowness shows as the framerate is horribly choppy. Plus the battery is built in. My new s4 has a removeable battery.The things I liked were speakers in front and screen, but the slowness and unresponsive nature of device made me switch. n
It is great!!! p
The phone is really good although the phone battery really sucks if you are heavy user like me. But if you don't play games it's good it will last for a day. The phone is a little bit slippery so I suggest get a case. The camera is good as long you don't have shakey hands. Try to download a better camera app. Or edit your pics for improvement of the color. Watching videos and listen to music is really great. The only thing I don't like it takes too much time to charge. But besides that I can say it's a great phone. But don't expect too much. But still it's one of the best phone in this price range. n
Second one for the family cheap and reasonable. p
I just started using the phone this afternoon. When I picked up the phone, it felt surprisingly light, and my first thought was that it felt cheap. However, the phone looks actually pretty elegant and unassuming. So far I haven't had any problem with it yet. p
I sent these phones to Ghana where I am told they work are working very well indeed. p
Great phone, no issues p
This phone worked fantastic for about 6 months. Now it's constantly having issues functioning and seems to be progressively getting worse. Little to no updates from the company. Sorry but I definitely won't ever purchase another phone made my this company. n
A great phone for the money. If you don't have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones. p
So far, a great phone. I did a lot of research when deciding on a new phone in this price range. I listen to a lot of music on the run and the tipping point in favor of the Idol 3, for me, was the front facing stereo speakers.I've had the phone for a few days now, and I'm very impressed with it. The user interface is pretty much stock Lollipop, which I really appreciate. There is very little bloatware/shovelware taking up memory and what there is can be easily removed. The camera is average and takes decent pictures under the right conditions. Bluetooth paired up with all my devices, even the more finicky devices that have given me fits in the past. Call quality is really good and the voices are clear on both ends. Signal reception has been the same as my old phone and I have had no issues connecting to the network. WIFI connections are as expected and I have had no issues.I dropped in a 128Gb micro SD card and it is working as expected. I haven't had a chance to test out the NFC connection, but It's nice to have this capability.The real shocker is the sound quality. The front facing stereo speakers are really impressive. They are loud and you can crank it up with no distortion. Everyone I've demo'ed this for has had the same reaction, "Whoa, that is impressive". Are you going to replace your home sound system? Of course not, But you get some pretty big sound from some pretty small speakers. The other surprise was from the included ear buds. I wasn't expecting much, but they sound pretty good for being included in the box. They have flat, no tangle cables and include different size ear pieces. They are a little flat sounding in the mid range, but not objectionably so. They won't replace my more expensive ear buds, but if these were the only ones I had, I'm not sure I would be that quick to replace them. I definitely won't be throwing these out.All in all I am very happy with this phone. It has great features and the sounds is incredible. On top of all that it functions well as a phone. In my opinion, this is a good value for the money. p
I"m giving this phone a 3 because there seems to be (for me) a fundamental flaw in the ergonomics of the phone. The way the switches are set up they are never in the right place. Also, I seem to be constantly grabbing the phone and hitting the switches at the same time, which seems to try and shut the phone down, or take a screenshot of the phone, neither of which I like. It took me a while to figure out that when I was trying to shoot a photo I was gripping the phone in a manner that I hit the buttons and it kept shutting down.I've had similar android phones and never had this issue.The icons are cartoon-y (I put an icon pack in to create shortcuts so I didn't have to look at them) and the phone seems rather slow to respond (for example, when you change screens or shut down the open apps). The phone seems to work ok, when I'm not having trouble manipulating it, and the setup was relatively simple and straightforward (coming from another unlocked android).I would not buy the phone again, but will keep it for now as I don't want the hassle of getting another phone. My old one stopped working so this purchase, while researched, was made a bit more quickly than I might of liked. n
I'm very pleased with the product, It met my expectations. p
This is a good phone for under 300 dollars.I would recommend this phone to anyone who don't want to spend a lot of money and want great performing phone.SG p
Had both ASUS ZenPone 2 and ALCATEL IDOL 3 for two of my family members. Both phones look great. Both handle 4g LTE well.Side by side comparison of the two:1) the IDOL3 got better and more premium sound for enjoying the movies/games than ZenPone 2.2) However, ZenPhone 2 got much faster responses in all apps comparing to IDOL 3. If you need to do multitasking and use business apps, I will choose ZenPhone 2, but not IDOL 3.3) Regarding the talk quality, ZenPhone 2 is better than IDOL 3!4) ZenPhone 2 is heavier than IDOL 3 and solidly build. In contrast, IDOL 3 is much lighter and more like a jewelry and prone to break.Both are good phones.Personally, I favor ASUS ZenPhone 2 than IDOL3 for its Two Sim capability/Faster responses/Easily handling the multitasking for my daily business usage. However, if you only need a phone for entrainment, than IDOL 3 is a better choice than ZenPhone 2 for its much better speaker sounds (but not for the talking quality). As a T mobile user in both phones, I found Zenfone 2 had a better talking quality than IDOL 3. n
Live the phone. Good reception not much bloatware . sluggish occasionally. Performance is great when not multitasking a lot. Camera is good.looks great I put a green slick wrap on mine. I'm happy with mine I upgraded slightly from an huawei ascend mate 2 because I'm tired of jellybean. Great for listening to music. p
I lucked out and was able to buy the Idol 3 for $199 shortly before midnight on Amazonâ€™s Prime Day blow-out. I gotta say, Alcatel did an exceptional design job on the Idol 3. I believe itâ€™s the best value smartphone on the market.Pros:- Superb screen. Easy to use in bright sunlight, which makes picture taking a breeze on a sunny day.- JBL sound, through both the speakers and the headset, is outstanding. The included JBL headphones are excellent with clear mids & highs and distortion-free tight bass.- The build quality on this phone is exceptional. Feels good in your hands, with no hint of cheapness, flimsiness, or low quality material Buttons presses are firm and manufacturing seams are aligned and tight. Itâ€™s also remarkably light and thin.- Before I got the phone I thought the reversible user interface (UI) was something that, although slick, I doubted Iâ€™d use very much. On the contrary, being able to reverse the UI comes in pretty handy and I use it quite a lot. For instance, sometimes itâ€™s convenient to have headphones plugged into the top of the phone, and other times itâ€™s better for me to have the cord coming out of the bottom (like on my dashboard car mount). With the reversible screen thatâ€™s not an issue.- I love the the double-tap feature. Super convenient, particularly in the car. However, it can occasionally be inconsistent. (see â€œConsâ€ below).- Volume & Power button placement: A lot of reviewers dislike the placement of the vol and power buttons because theyâ€™re located high on the phoneâ€™s sides. However, I actually prefer this button placement because: a) as Iâ€™m holding or carrying the phone, Iâ€™m not constantly hitting the buttons, and, b) in my car, it allows me to put the phone in my dashboard car mount such that the mountâ€™s clamp is not pressing the buttons.- Call quality: Call quality is good. I hear no distortion or tinny-ness.- Overall processor performance: Iâ€™m not a big-time power user or gamer, so the Idol 3 performs reliably and predictably for me. Occasionally I do experience a slight stutter, but itâ€™s so minor that itâ€™s no big deal. Navigation around the UI is generally smooth and hiccup-free.- Camera: Picture quality stacks up nicely with other phones, some which cost a lot more. For all but the most demanding needs, the Idol 3 will deliver crisp, focused shots with good color balance. I have not used it much in low light, so I canâ€™t comment on that aspect.- GPS locks on quickly, and Wi-Fi connects reliably.- Battery life: the Idol 3â€™s battery life is a dream compared to my old HTC Inspire, which I had to recharge throughout a typical workday. Iâ€™m easily getting thru my workday with charge to spare. The battery charges quickly too, due to the 2amp wall charger.Cons:- An occasional UI stutter, as mentioned above.- The volume sliders can only be set to 8 incremental, discrete intervals; I wish the volume sliders were continuously variable (like the brightness slider).- The Idol 3â€™s vibration mode is very weak. If the phone is set to vibrate mode and itâ€™s laying on my desk, I often cannot detect when a vibrating call or text is coming in.- If you have the double-tap feature enabled, you sometimes have to repeatedly double-tap in order to wake the screen up, particularly when itâ€™s been asleep for an extended period.- This is big phone and will take a bit of getting used to if you have smaller hands. Although, I must say itâ€™s nicely balanced. I have med/large hands and didnâ€™t find the Idol 3 particularly slippery or hard to grip.- The user manual is not very comprehensive. Tech support is located in Guadalajara, Mexico. I called tech support to address a few questions I had; the support I received was of average competence, â€¦ not terrible but not great.In Conclusion:The overall performance of the Idol 3 at the $249 price point is outstanding. Itâ€™s half the price of, say, an LG G4, and side-by-side, stacks up nicely. The phone does everything I ask of it and then some. Call quality is good, the speakers kick some serious butt, the screen resolution and brightness are superb, the camera works great for me, and battery life is excellent. Unless you just have to have top-tier specs, this is the best â€œbang for the buckâ€ smartphone on the market. p
Good p
Very much satisfied, I will give the seller more then 5 stars. p
Excellent phone, poor documentation. p
Awesome phone. Had to return it due to signal issues. I will probably buy it again after some updates get released. p
After about a week of use, I have very little to complain about with this phone. The very bright and sharp display is easy to read in sunlight, the sound is as clear and loud as I've ever seen in a smartphone. Was worried that the 5.5" screen would feel too big in my hand, but it actually fits well in my hand. The power button placement is a little high on the left side, but I've already gotten used to it. 4G LTE reception with Cricket Wireless has been solid, and I get a full day of battery life, even with a few hours of screen time. The phone feels thin and light but still feels solid. I'm still mastering the camera, finding that tapping the subject of your photo before taking does a great job of setting the proper exposure, especially in shots where there's something brighter than your subject elsewhere in the photo. p
Amazing value. Great phone. Great reception. Excellent display. Good speakers. Updates are a bit flaky. First one messed up texting functionality and the third threw my phone into an endless reboot cycle. I ended up booting in safe mode, and eventually got the phone to boot again without having to wipe it. Sharing videos over email is still broken, which is very annoying. Maybe the next update will fix it. Only downside of this device is that it doesn't ship with stock Android, although it's pretty close (very few software enhancements and no bloatware). p
Beautiful, works great just advertised. Only problem was getting it set up by consumer cellular. It took four agents to finally get it right. Two agents and a supervisor told me it wouldn't work with their system. I'm so glad I persisted until I got a customer service rep that knew what to do. Great battery life. Since it is new I'll have to wait and seehow it works long term. p
Sent back very laggy when using chrome n
excellent good phone all I would like to work more in the chamber for dark shots p
Pros:Speakers are loudest I've heardDisplay is bright and vividThe speed is pretty fast once you remove the minimal bloat, especially the antivirusVery lightweightBattery life was decentCons:Bad LTE receptionCamera wasn't very good, the flash is way too weak so low light is abysmalTap 2 wake is spotty, sometimes because it's slow to wake up. I'd rather just disable itUgly branding on the back. Sticker would solve thisNot many cases out thereOverall:I returned this thing. A phone that loses signal (0 bars!) between towers on the 405 freeway in LA? I'm not T-Mobile, and my cheap old LG F6 was a beast compared to this. My new LG G4 picks it up fine, too. I gave the Idol 3 a chance. Did Alcatel not even test this one bit in the field? What good is band 12 if I have trouble with band 4?!?! n
I'll admit it, I've got a phone problem. I tire of phones quickly and also get irritated by them. I've used nearly every flagship device on the market. This device keeps pace with any flagship that's a generation old and blows away mid range device it's designed to compete with.The camera is good, voice calls are good, display is excellent even in direct light, and it's responsive even when multi tasking.You may not like the fixed battery or the almost stock Android. Samsung, HTC, and LG all have "skins" that make for a nicer user experience.I will update my review with real battery life numbers. 2 days in the battery seems like plenty to get you through a day.Before you fork over $30 per month for the next 2 years, or worse yet sign a contract, give this phone a shot. p
Great smart phone. Gets a bit sluggish from time to time, but I still like it. It's big, thin and the battery last all day. A bang for the buck! p
I have had the phone for a week now and here is my honest opinion. As you see, that I have given the phone 5 stars. This rating is for comparison to other phones in it's price range. I am not going to try and compare this phone with IPhone or Samsung. I have T-Mobile and I am on a no-contract employee plan that requires me to buy my phones outright. So price is a BIG deal. IMO the phone is great! Here are my honest thoughts:- Screen Size and looks is great! Very readable in the sun. Well above it's $250 price tag- The ONLY lag I ever experience is when I am sweeping running apps. And that is hardly a lag. It is very fluid and responsive.- No Dropped Calls- My LTE T-Mobile data has been 12.5 mbps- Front facings speakers are amazing and sound great. BUT they are louder than I want them to be at the lowest setting. I have Triplets Babies and when they are asleep, I can't have headphones in and the audio on the lowest setting is still too loud.- The Camera is Great! No issues or complaints.- The double tap to turn it on is unreliable and works less than 50% of the time. Double tapping to turn off works just fine.- BUT I am right handed and I have no issues with where the on/off button is. I don't know why others have complained.- I love the I can talk into either end of the phone. Especially when using the google search. It hears me every time!- The GPS is great and on-time! The front facing speakers were great to hear the turn by turn directions.- The head phones sound great!- The reversible setting is awesome and such a duh idea.- This may be an Android problem but is really annoyingâ€¦ but any group messaging that I have gets a date of Jan 17, 1970 and so they just sit at the bottom of my messages log. Itâ€™s VERY Annoying and I canâ€™t figure out how to fix that. Anyone else have this problem?- Battery Life is about a day in a half. I use my phone mostly with Calls, Texts, Twitter, Facebook, Email, Camera, Internet. (Occasionally the GPS and Netflix, no gaming.)- In all, the phone is not "perfect". But just as close as it's going to be at this price. Definitely worth 5 stars and I recommend it every time!Now I just need a case. Not a bulky one. Any recommendations? p
At this price I think that Idole 3 can be considered one of the best smartphones on the market.It is a good device and very easy to handle.PRO: LTE frequencies working with AT&T and other US carriers, Android Lollipop, excellent and brilliant screen, very good cameras (front camera is 8 mp!), excellent stereo speakers, good battery.CON: processor MSM8939 is not fast: avoid multitasking! audio during calls could have a little more clarity. p
Fantastic screen, good performance, good battery life. Overall: A+ p
yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK p
Pluses:Price: about $100 (can't believe this much phone for the money)Display: 1080P while it's not AMOLED, really pretty for the $Sound: stereo speakers rock. Easily the best sound I've ever heard from a phone. While it's not loud enough for a large party, it is great for at home listening.Camera: 13MP camera takes good pictures. Low light is not excellent but, again, for the price, very nice.Expandable memory: Has a double slot for Sim and micro SD card. Even my Moto X didn't do that.Battery: Makes it through the whole day with moderately heavy use. You can kill it if you try hard enough but I usually have half a charge left after a long day.Minuses: There appears to be no way to stop "full battery" notifications. If you have it by your bed at night, it is annoying to be notified of a full battery at 3AM.Speed: While adequate, there is some lag with multiple applications open. To me, just mildly irritating but this might be a deal breaker for power users. p
Luv luv luv my phone p
Using at&t go phone sim...operates 6.01 marshmellow ...more than enough phone. I', in the boonies and gets reception. p
The screen is very bright and sharp but not as colorful as a Super AMOLED screen. The speakers are very loud and clear. compared to others. There is processor lag when overloaded with tasks. I don't mind not having a fingerprint sensor because this is a mid range phone after all. Camera is pretty good. I prefer polished aluminum but the design of this plastic phone is very beautiful. Good durability in my opinion when properly cased AND screen protected of coarse. Has survived many drops from my kiddos. The user interface is almost stock Android, very easy to navigate. This is a perfect starter phone for a younger adolescent,older adult or daily user on the go. p
Great phone, great price. I shopped around for a budget-priced phone with up to date specs. I spent days on this, and decided on this phone because it was $100 less than I was willing to spend but it still had everything I needed. My only concern at purchase was I thought battery life would be an issue coming off a phone with a 5000 MaH battery I had with the BLU Studio Energy 2. What I do is go into settings and turn on battery saver immediately after taking the phone off the charger. That way I get about 18 hours of fairly active use, calling, texting, streaming video, listening to audio. Then I put on charger and am ready for the next day. It has a 2950 MaH battery but lasts more like a 4000 MaH one on battery saver mode. Phone is super fast with octa-core processor, even running on battery saver - I can't really tell the difference in performance, but it's limiting the background processes that drain the juice out of most phones. Phone ships with Android 5.1, but it quickly upgrades to the newer Android Marshmallow 6.0 software upon initial bootup. Also, phone has an 8MP selfie camera, 5MP is standard on many phones which is ice. The front camera is decent at 13MP, on par with a Samsung S6. Nice display and beautiful video. At 5.5" it's the right size and the build quality is impressive. Good sound from the JBL twin speakers, you can actually hear. Call quality seems to be good (I'm on Cricket), and the speakerphone comes in loud and clear. It even comes with NFC built-in if that's important to you. Overall, it's a 5-star phone at a 3-star price point and it has my highest recommendation. p
Phone came in perfect conditions, fast shipping, it's a game changer, best phone for his price, specs, screen, batery.Just one thign it's that lag in his original Android 5.0, update after purchased to marshmallow y voila u have a awesome flashkiller p
This is the cheapest phone I've ever bought and one of the best I've ever had. Having used it constantly everyday for almost a month now I knew I had to review it.Let's start with the physical: The phone is thin with a sleek design comparable to some flagships out there. It is ultra lightweight to the point that I don't feel it in my purse; sometimes I actually rummage through my bag to make sure it's still there. The screen is big and pictures are clear and crisp. Same sound-wise, I haven't had any dropped calls or had people on the other end telling me they can't hear me so it's definitely a jump up from my last android which was more than double the price.Now the technical: To start with I purchased a 32gb SDHC card to take advantage of the expandable storage so I didn't have to skimp out on any apps I used, and as a long time T-Mobile customer I was able to get the SIM card for free. I immediately put the cards in and voila I had a working phone. [Disclaimer: There are no features from T-Mobile that I do not have access to, unless there are features out there that I am not aware of].So the important stuff, I am in love with the eye scanner (HOW COOL IS THAT) which can be used as a lock screen mechanism. It makes me feel like a secret spy agent! Unlike fingerprint readers which seem outdated now, I'm able to impress my friends and family with an eye scanner. I also very much enjoy the camera which pulls up with two presses of the power button, it beats tapping on a screen that isn't always responsive in a moment's notice. I can capture vital images quickly and accurately in a moving vehicle or when I'm at a concert, which is simply awesome especially for the price tag. Lastly, the fast charging nature of this phone puts me in awe. I use the phone for hours on end and yes the battery drains like a normal phone does, but then all I have to do is plug it in and my phone gets charged in no time! I can also keep playing my games, video chatting and having multiple apps and webpages open with no lag and without pausing to let the phone charge, and a regular car charger gets my phone charged even when I have Waze or Google Maps on.Overall I highly recommend this phone, if it somehow died I would buy another one without hesitation. This phone is comparable to flagships in terms of design and basic features one looks for in a phone. And for the price it truly is unbeatable without being inferior. p
good p
Surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. Have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. Has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. Able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything. p
Quality is amazing for the price .. Audio is nice, camera quality is pretty decent, charges very quickly and lasts for the day.. Well (It depends on how much you use it.) But to be honest, this is by far the best 100 bucks I've ever spent ðŸ˜Advise: Get a screen protecter, preferably glass and you're fine. p
I am an iPhone freak. I was looking to add another phone(a moderately priced one as it'll only serve as my iPhone's 'assistant') with a different OS from apple's iOS. A phone with the android OS was my preferred choice. I gave up on my search because I didn't get what I needed in a moderately priced android phone till I saw a friend with the 4.7 inch version of the idol 3. I browsed through and was like 'whaaat, Alcatel did this'? The phone fast, has a good camera, has good speakers and good battery life, because after about 30 minutes of watching videos, the battery didn't drain as it would've on my iPhone 6. I bought one of the 4.7 for my personal use due to its cute size and 4 of the 5.5 to sell. In my country, bigger screen phones sells faster, plus the 5.5 is the better of the two in terms of performance. It's been about a year now and none of the buyers has called to complain about anything. A special someone needs an android OS phone and the only phone that came to mind was the idol 3, my reason for buying again. We had an issue before I received the phone. I am waiting till the issue is resolved before presenting the phone. She'll love it(because she's always praised mine every time she's played with it), and even more because this screen size bigger than mine. p
haven't ever experienced terrible phone like this.it does not touch well. I have to click more than one time.one day i found that all the app data gone. I had to log in all the apps, and change the settings in each app.it works slow just like snapdragon 400 series n
I was really surprised on how well it works p
I hate smartphones. Only the need for an unlocked device persuaded me to sup with the devil. I long for a simple flip-phone. OK this phartsmone seems to be very acceptable. Once I figured out how to answer a phone call I was very happy. What I cannot shake is the feeling that all these icon things are sucking my PAYG airtime into a black hole. So I keep it turned off - that defeats the gremlins! Should you buy this phone? I'd say it does the job that you would expect of a more expensive unit and it's worth the money. I transitioned from the USA to South Africa and it's fine. I'm not fond of micro-sims for SA because the USB modems for my laptop take full size sims and I don't want to access the internet from a phone, dammit. I hate it. But you'll like it because you are not old and crotchety like me. p
Fast shipping,good phone p
Mobile is excellent and I bought it for my wife and she liked it a lot.. p
Is an acceptable phone considering it costs about 140 dollarsOctacoreNice speakers (JBL)Acceptable screen.Android 6I havethis phone about a month, and restart only once. I don't know what will happen in the future, but is enough phone for me. p
This phone failed 34 days after my order. I have no recourse to return based on the 30 day policy. There is not even a clear ability to communicate to Amazon about this.This is an unfortunate customer service issueWould not purchase again n
Marvelous screen, camera, speaker sound. p
I have been using it for only a couple of weeks and it is working quite nicely. A great improvement from my previous Alcatel phone. I only wish there were a phone with the same specifications in a smaller size, like a 5" or less. I was torn between this one and the ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 4.7 HD. However, this one is much better in all aspects except size. So, it is a compromise for me.If it weren't for that I would probably be closer to 5 stars. p
Very good value for the price, couldn't for more for a $100 phone. p
Bought for $132 phone design is horrible. SD and sim card slot breaks after taking it out one time. Go look at videos for installing a sim on this phone its a joke. The battery is not removable. The screen shows every finger mark. Its slow and the camera is not good either. The only thing good is that it has a full HD resolution (1080), and a large screen. The customer service for Alcatel is disgusting. The guy I was chatting to just simply ignored me, and when I tried to connect to someone who would help me it just kept redirecting me to the same guy. This phone is worth no more than $100. Overall disappointed. n
Its a good Phone for the price, I am absolutly happy with it p
Asked for refund product not working n
What can you say, it is made in China and that means GOOD REAL GOOD to me.I have several others and they are all excellent.I travel to China on vacation and I use a China Mobile Simm, no problems. GREAT PHONE.Uses AT&T and is really 4G LTE and it works great and in China is also excellent!!!!!!! p
Love It p
if u have no ther option, then u better stay with no phone. Days 1 thru 3 were good. Then everything went downhill. The phone lags, it stutters, it freezes to the point where it begins to get hot and it locks up. The phone did feel ok in the hand. oh yeah and the speakers were good. n
Can't beat this phone for the price! I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 and haven't looked back.My only complaint is the lack of removable battery, but luckily that hasn't been an issue yet. p
Great deal for price. Thin, great battery life, sharp and bright screen. This not a low end phone as price would suggest. You can get half a dozen of these for the price of an Iphone. My wife has had one for a year with no issues so I replaced my Fire phone with one to get the larger screen. Fire phone still has the best interface. Wish Amazon had keep up development on it p
This is the second one I purchased, one for each parent. Since the price had dropped significantly it was a steal. At under $200 this phone is a solid buy. So far it's up to Marshmallow, and has a great screen, great performance, and amazing dual front facing speakers. Battery like is solid and the added benefit of expandable storage with a very stock interface (after adding the Google launcher) are an added bonus. The only issue with this phone is the camera. It's slow, and in medium to low light blurring does occur. I expect this from a phone at this price, but if you have decent light and steady hands you can take average photos. p
Update December 30th, 2015:* I had to downgrade my rating to a 3 star because after 6 months of usage the phone is noticeably showing wear and tear of being a cheap phone. I had no illusion that the phone would be masterfully constructed at the price point. At this point I can feel that the phone creaks if bent a little bit, and I can see that my screen cover's glue has come off at one edge. To top this off the camera has failed me recently, and I'm in the process of submitting a warranty claim. If that goes well and this are better, then I'll consider bumping the star rating back up to 4 stars....Original Review follows, and all of these things are still true for me. I do really love what this phone got right, its just too bad its not constructed better...Here are a few thing that should make you want this phone:* The Camera app - Alcatel seems to have made their own camera app, and do not use the Android stock app (which if you want you could install from the app store). But this app I feel like is superior to the android one. It does virtually no hunting for focus, and takes photos immediately when you press the shutter button. I feel like this gives the camera a distinctly Apple Iphone feel to it, and have been pleasantly surprised. The Google Camera app does not function as smoothly, and am glad to have an alternative with the Alcatel. Others have commented on the actual camera photo quality itself, which I have not tested, but honestly for my use I'm glad that the app just functions fast.* The phone is pretty much stock android. I put the Google Now Launcher on my phone and the experience is almost exactly the same as my old Nexus 4. There are a few pre-loaded apps, but you can easily remove them. The ones that you can't remove are system apps like the android gallery, and the Mix application which is a music player. Both can be ignored for your applications of choice.With that said, other reviews have done a good job of describing the phone and its pros and cons. I just wanted to add the only reason I can't give it a 5, is that while it is awesome for the price, it still has its drawbacks. It does so many things great, and they got many features totally right. But after using it for 4 or 5 days, I begin to notice the areas where they had to cut corners to get it to the price it is at. These things have been mentioned in other reviews already. With that said. Its amazing how much they do for the price, but they haven't quite hidden the reasons you might want a more expensive phone, in my opinion. If you're already in the market for spending this much, instead of buying something much more expensive, then I can say you should definitely just buy it and try it out. n
Nice smartphone p
for 250 this phone is pretty good i wanted to buy an unlocked phone that i can use with any gsm carrier i feel i made the right choice with this, coming from an iphone 6 plus you can tell its a little slower when browsing the web but the rest is fine with me i also love that i can extend my memory with an sd card, i am also happy this has lte im paying $35 A MONTH now for unl talk n text and 2gb of LTE cant beat that p
I moved from a Note II (T-Mobile) to this Idol 3. I got tired of carrying around a phone that had extra weight and size due to a stylus I never used. I got in on the original pre-order price of $200 and decided to give it a try. I have had the phone a little over a week and would like to run down some of my thoughts.- I like the screen, it is clear and bright and I donâ€™t find myself missing my AMOLED from my Note II.- The screen is very visible in direct sunlight, way better than my Note II, wifeâ€™s S3 or G2.- I do not mind the left side power button (Iâ€™m left handed) but it takes some getting used to.- Regarding the above I am aware the phone has a double tap to wake/sleep function however I have found it very inconsistent. My wifeâ€™s G2 is much more consistent, I would say hers works 95% of the time and this about 50% (to wake, to sleep is much more consistent). I sent an email to Alcatel and they claim they are aware of this issue and plan on addressing it in an update.- It is very light and easy to use with my â€œmediumâ€ sized guy hands.- Case selection is somewhat limited.- It works well with T-Mobile, I get LTE where I did with my Note II and have no issue with wifi, Bluetooth or GPS. I do miss the stock T-Mobile voicemail app (the play store one is buggy).- The camera is quick to focus and takes pretty good photos. Video is good as well. I consider it as good as the one I had on my Note II (I liked that camera).- I like that it is not cluttered with bloat wear. My T-Mobile branded phone was loaded with all kinds of appâ€™s I could not remove. I think this lends to the phoneâ€™s efficient use of resources.- Battery life has been good so far, I get through a day. I am a bit apprehensive about the lack of a replaceable battery. I always like the idea of being able to replace/swap mine on my Note II.6/12/15 Update -- The lowest setting for volume for the notifications is way to loud. There are plenty of apps to "boost" volume but I can not find a good one for a work around here.- I have not been get 5ish hours of screen on time as many reviewers state. I usually get to about 4 with about 10% battery left. I am not a heavy gamer. Just email, reading web pages and texting. A smattering of clash of clans here and there. p
What can I say?Great phone. Loud speakers, good camera, stock google lollipop!Great battery life!Bright screen, and processor barely shows its budget price.If you want a phone for 250, this is the best option for ya. Best all around phone at this price. p
Great phone but it came with a couple of dead pixels right in the center of the screen. I've never run into dead pixels on a phone before. Returned and waiting for another. n
Got tired of having a contract and over paying for service with a lagy phone that I feel is over priced. This phone has delivered for me exactly what I need, keeps it simple with the OS and features, 2GB are enough for me and my multitasking, it came with an update right out of the box but I have yet to do it. Double tap to wake works, Thou spoty at times, but it works. Great front facing speakers that are loud and clear and the supplied headphones are just perfect. Camera is pretty good, for $250 you get more than what you pay for and the battery life is better than I was expecting, can't go wrong and I have bragged please type to people about this phone. p
Originally I gave this phone a stellar review. However, this phone is a case of you get what you pay for. It stopped charging at 5 week. I just missed the amazon return policy window. n
I decided to buy this phone on a whim after reading several early reviews. I'm glad I did. No, it's not perfect, but you have to consider what you get for your money. Other reviewers have gone into great detail about pros and cons so I won't repeat here. There are a few quirks, but in my opinion, the pros far outweigh the cons. I thought there was a problem with my external SD card when I couldn't access files on the card. It turned out my card was formatted in exFat. Once I formatted it to Fat32, all was well. When I was setting up my phone I somehow lost 2 screen panels and ended up with only one. I had to factory reset and that cured the problem. Also, sometimes the screen digitizer can be a little balky. The speakers are quite good as are the included earbuds. Maybe not as good as HTC's, but still good. The screen is very good for a phone at this price point. The camera was also a pleasant surprise. No, it won't beat the Galaxy S6 or iphone6, but you won't be disappointed either. I found no lag others have mentioned, but then again, I don't play games or launch multiple apps at once. For what I do, it was as smooth as butter. You will get through a day on the battery unless you are a heavy user. Unless you're a true perfectionist, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with this phone when they consider it cost $250 for a no-contract, unlocked phone. p
This phone is really good I recommended to anybody this is a gret phone for the prise p
Guys excellent phone than moto g play all with jbl speakers and headphones just buy first and than see the magic good budgeted phone just for 99 dollars p
I bought this phone for 99dollars .for 99 dollars its a decent phone . If it costs more than 99 dollars I would send it back . I picked it up for a back up phone. I decided to give it a test drive. This phone isn't very powerful . I am going to give a review on what's important to me. 1. Signal. It's allover the place fading in from full bars to no bars of LTE . I discovered if I put it in hspa it's fairly stable . In areas that have a great LTE Signal It's fantastic. 2. Call quality. It's middle of the road not great , not horrible. The moto g4 plus is way better , but the g4 has VOLTE . The idol 3 doesnt.3, battery , it's a little better than okay . If I don't use it , it will last . If I do use it it is just like every other phone .4. Responsiveness. I have a galaxy s7 edge . I am used to touchwiz lag . This phone lags as much as my Samsung . I did change the settings in developer options. 5. Screen ..not bad its fairly bright. 6. Storage it's been updated to 6.1,1. It now has adaptive storage . Buy a good SD card if you are going to use it as adaptive storage.7. Size for 5.5 it feels pretty small and very light. I put a glass screen protector on and my favorite slim case. It feels and looks pretty nice.8. Emails and text they work well. I think if t-mobile didn't force Alcatel to disable band 12 (or if Alcatel paid for band 12 license this review would be better. All in all if you can grab it for 99$ do it. But for more go with the honor 5x or moto g4 . For some reason I like this phone .its over a year old now and still a decent performer . p
I have never owned a smartphone because I am always near a computer or a family member with a smartphone. On a recent trip, I was amazed at how useful their phones were during our travel (Uber, Lyfte, AirBNB, Airline information, Maps) and decided I would get ready for my contract renewal in a few months, by getting a cheap smartphone and loading it up, via WIFI connection at home. Read the reviews and this one was priced at $99. Why not? It's been a week, and it has been eye-opening. It's replacing my clip on MP3 player, cause it plays MP4s as well. The sound is incredible. I have a 64 GB microSD with all my music, that I hot swap into the phone's dual slide. The slide has space for a microSD and a SIM card. I enjoy the built-in radio, Skyping, and using Viber on my WIFI. I've got apps to read Word and Excel documents, my G-mail updates...it goes on and on. It does take around 20 seconds to boot to a visible screen once you press the on button, and I think that may fool many into thinking the phone isn't working, as they repeating hit the on/off button. Just push on, and have patience. The OS also rebooted several times over the first few days, but after a week, that has finally stopped. Camera takes good pictures but not great. It's been fun, and I haven't even activated my phone yet. Once I do, and probably with Cricket, which uses AT&T towers, everything should be ready and I won't have a learning curve. p
This phone is very slow. Want to navigate somewhere? Well, it might take 3 minutes to load your directions. It also sends and receives group messages from 1970. Very inconvenient because they come in at the bottom your message inbox. It also broke after 6 months. I would not buy this item again! In fact, I despite the money lost I am relived that it broke. n
I just love it and it was a big deal!!! :D p
this was a great deal at $99. Most reviews don't mention the fact that it as facial recognition and iris scanner as an option to unlock it too. That's something iPhone 7 doesn't even have. I use mine with a magnetic holder in my car with no case necessary since the magnet sticks to where the battery is. Not many other phones do that. The reversible feature is cool too. All the reviews on youtube say it's a great deal at $249. There is no other 5.5", HD, microSD expandable android phone out there nearly this good at anywhere near this price. p
Very good product! An improvement over my 2 year old moto g no doubt. My one and only issue so far is that sometimes it doesn't respond right away opening an app p
Take a step back and think about this thing. It has an identical screen to, and RAM of, an Iphone 6 Plus, for a sixth the price. Pop in an SD for more storage. Similar or better form factor too, with nice stereo speakers and better earbuds than an Iphone. Performance is smooth, and it updated immediately to Marshmallow. What's not to like?I guess one thing. Reports around the web indicate the screen may crack under light pressure/drops. So get a case and screen protector. Because this is an older model phone, both can be found cheap at the usual suspects. p
Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you p
Gracias, excelente. p
Slow and dead at 14 months. I liked the bright screen and the sound but it no longer works. n
Good sized phone with no connection issues. The price is not too high for anyone looking for something with an HD screen. p
I have had this phone for almost a week. Not one problem. Other than a few lags here and there. A great phone for a unheard of price. I paid $150 for this phone and it runs and feels like a $800 flagship phone. Only down side is I wish it had 4 Gigabyte's of RAM and not the 2 Gigabyte's. p
Phone suffered a screen crack riding in my pocket for 5 minutes while driving 2 months after being purchased. Not very durable. I would not buy it again. n
Very good phone p
Great phone, great service, and fast. Really great music and headphones. p
Amazing phone for the price. If you're looking for a good Android device and don't want to throw down a chunk, this is well worth it. p
i have had this phone for 2 months now and I do not regret buying it. It is super amazing. p
Haven't gotten around to thinking about dislikes yet p
Great phone, really loved the quality of the build. feels a quality product very good value for Money. p
Best Phone I've owned so far, it is just amazing. i Love it. it is just as described. The sound quality is amazing, the Speed, the Camera, the gaming capabilities, watching videos on this device gives you the best experience, everything about this phone is awesome.For only $250.00 this is the best phone there is. p
I'm glad I waited when it dropped in price to purchase this and yes I love it cause I'm hard of hearing and the speakers are loud for me, unlike other devices I've had. I would recommend this for anyone who's hard of hearing.I was deciding between this and the Asus ZenFone2 and went by reviews both had good reviews, but I went with the Idol.The camera is good, but I use a different camera app with it for more effects.The battery life is great and it charges quickly more than an Android tablet I have.The screen is nice and clear, the ease of access is good and Alcatel does do the update, for it when it lets you know for an OTA.The only non-issues I have that's there's not enough accessories being the fact it's been out for a few months. Been looking for a Qi charging receiver, tho Alcatel has one, but no one has made a review for it on here. B 3 bottom right is what I'm searching for.I really don't do reviews, but this I thought I would do. p
For the price, the only device that can compare to this for the price is the zenfone 2. The zf2 has a more powerful processor, GPU and 2x the ram for $50 more. Even though I'm usually all about specifications on my devices, I don't play graphically intense games on my phone. (that's what a PC or console is for in my opinion) So I'll take the better screen, slimmer profile, almost completely stock version of Android and the dual JBL audio front facing speakers any day over the slight difference in performance.I've seen some reviews of people receiving units with a few annoying problems but I'm assuming those are either factory defects or refurbished units because I've had nothing but good experiences so far with mine.If I had to find something negative to say about this phone, I'd say the power button placement doesn't make sense at all even for a lefty. But the factory software does allow for double tap to wake and the display does rotate 180Â° in portrait which takes care of the button placement for the most part. The second thing is that I've noticed a few stutters here and there, and considering I came from a note 3 with the SD800, these slight stutters happen so infrequently that it doesn't bother me and I didn't really pay attention to them till I read about it in some reviews. Either way, I'm pretty sure this is because of the software optimization because other SD615 devices run smother. Hopefully an update to 5.1 or even marshmallow will cure this. If not, bootloader is already unlocked, root is her and there's already twrp available. Custom ROMs should be available soon too. p
Got this when my Nexus 5 died and was amazed at the progress made in android phones since I got the N5 a year ago. For less than half the price of my N5 I got a phone with comparable screen, better battery (being able to charge my phone 1/day is a game changer), better speakers, better camera. Granted the Idol doesn't have the benchmarks of the N5 (or the ZenPhone2) but I haven't noticed it at all in everyday use.If you want a great unlocked phone (with all the GSM LTE bands) and don't want to pay $600, get this phone. p
Terrible call quality, multiple people told me during calls on speakerphone that I sounded far away and that they couldn't hear me well. Maybe it's due to the speakers during calls. I promptly returned. I wonder if the 4.7 inch version also has this same problem n
Great phone while it worked right but still Luke other Alcatel phones the power button failed to work n
So first phone I received had some problems, but they were very cooperative at getting me a new one and I got it very fast. This phone has blown me away with what you get with the price. The audio is amazing its up there with the HTC one m8 in my opinion. Only complaint I have is that the original one I recieveced had very nice jbl headphones, and the second one had much cheaper headphones. That doesn't concern the phone but that was quite the disappointment. Had the phone for several months now and I still hold it in the highest regard. Blows the HTC one I had before this, out of the water in every way. And now its 30$ cheaper then when I got it. Even more of a steal. p
This thing is awesome. The battery life is great, i get 4-5 hours of screen on time with half brightness which is great because the speakers cannot be beaten at this price point. They sure beat my old HTC One M7 boom sound speakers. I bought this phone and a case along with a 64 gig Sandisk memory card all under 280 dollars. I like to watch a lot of media so the beautiful big screen and dual front facing speakers is was sold me. The camera is not the best in the world, but more than enough for social media. You can take some real nice shots with it. All in all its a great phone! p
So far, so good! p
The size is perfect for average guy. It's large enough for typing w/ 2 thumbs, and small enough for use w/ one hand.The phone is light. So it doesn't bounce around in pants pocket.The battery life is good for a lite user. With cell data mostly off, I typically get 3-4 days.The case design allows secure fit for the soft shell, while exposing the forward facing speakers. Make sure to get a shell, or it might not survive a drop.The only downside is the SD card. It is in the same tray as the Sim card. When I take it out to transfer large files, sometimes it takes a few tries to get both cards aligned when inserting. p
First things first, this is not a perfect phone, but it is pretty damn close and factoring the price I got it for $99, this has been one of the better phones I have used recently. So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didnâ€™t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didnâ€™t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isnâ€™t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts donâ€™t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the â€œenhanced 4G LTEâ€ setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the â€œcoolerâ€ side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to â€œautoâ€ when you go into an extremely bright or dark area. p
buy mobile to you, but I do not work 3G band is only 2G and LTE, also does not come with the onetouch stream. n
I paid $99 here on Amazon and honestly not sure how anyone is staying in business for these specs at that price. The only thing really lacking is a gyroscope but for the price I can't really complain that it's missing. This is loaded with android 6.0.1, everything seems really snappy. This is the first phone I've used with soft keys and it's not bad. The front facing speakers are surprisingly good. However compared to my last phone the audio stream over blutooth is not as loud, meaning in my car I have to turn the dial up in order to have the same volume. I'd advise turning off the JBL special effects otherwise you'll end up with muddled music that is overly bassy, Although maybe you'll like it. The key is that you can atleast toggle this feature on or off depending on your taste.Pros:Nice screen sizePleasant designFront facing speakers sound really great (but will sound distorted at max volume)Speaker and microphone on both sides so you can answer/talk no matter which orientation you have the phone.Micro SD storageLong lasting batteryScreen will work in any orientation (nice for when you want to have the charging cable on the top vs bottom while in the car)Con:No gyroscope p
Hi.The description of the product say: Is global unlocked and can use in 4LTE but it doesnt work, If you can help me I'll really appreciate that.Anything else is ok.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty) n
A great phone but I spend way too much on other accessories which had me throwing it away in the trash. p
Really good phone for the price ($99.99) the phone works well and I am very satisfied with my purchase. The phone has 13mp back camera and it can shoot 1080p HD videos. My service provider is Metro PCS and they were able to activate my phone without any trouble. However I paid a $25 activation fee because I had to purchase a new sim card. Overall i am happy with the phone and i hope it will last a while. p
I'm using this phone 3 weeks now and so far have no complains. I'm not a power user which menas mostly web browsing, Viber, messaging, phone calls etc. My sone downloaded some quite demanding games on it and all were running with no issues. The device is always on WiFi or LTE and I can get a 1.5 days from it easily (4.5 hours SOT).There are some intermittent lags I notice but not really significant. Most of the times the phone is very responsive.I like very much how it looks and it's screen size and quality.My previous phone was Nokia Lumia 830 which had very good rear camera but do not feel this phone is a step back.Overall for 160$ on Amazon this was a very good deal. Hopefully it'll carry at least an year and more. p
Needed a new phone since I broke the screen on my new galaxy 5 in the first 2 months I owned it. I read the reviews and ordered the Idol 3 since it was cheaper than replacing the screen and digitized on the Samsung. I just hoped for the best, and can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised. The phone looks, feels and operates like a quality product. I like it and its features better than the Samsung. I have had it about a week and could not be more satisfied. We'll see how it goes, but as of now I highly recommend this phone. p
It didn't work. Had a mind of its own. I need to send it back! This was my 2nd one.It did the same thing. I've sworn off Alcatel for good. n
Nice phone for what I paid (99). I'd much rather pay this price whenever my phone breaks then paying 600-800 for another phone!Overall good buy. Works well, has nice features. p
Just recieved the Idol 3 phone by Alcatel. I was a little sceptical about reading a lot of negative reviews about the camera on this phone, but I also own the Alcatel Pop One Touch, which takes very nice pictures usually without even using the flash! So, the first I did was to compare my old phone camera with the new one. I took the same pictures side by side, and this is what I found. Out of the box the new cameras exposure settings needed to be adjusted. If you click on the upper left of the camera screen, (there are three short lines), then choose settings--you will see exposure settings, click on the number 1 setting-- (Not -1). This will lighten up the screen for better picture taking. Under normal circumstances, you will not need a flash even inside your home! This will greatly improve your all around camera quality!! Hope it helps!! Great phone! p
This phone is amazing . I have a galaxy s4 purchased new when it came out 5 years ago . This phone is right there with it except its bigger and 10 times brighter and vibrant compared to my s4 phone. When My s4 finally dies out this will be waiting to replace it .the only thing they need to mark is where the sim card removal tool is it took me 20 minitues trying to find it p
Super phone. Poor battery. p
This is a great phone for those of us who want a VERY nice, large screen, excellent battery life and don't need the fastest phone on the market. Yeah, it's slower than the Sammie S6 I got from work, but it isn't a long, painful wait for it to complete a task, just a slight hesitation. Unless you are a serious power user I doubt you'll have a problem with performance. The battery life is better than the S6. And it works as well as the Samsung as an actual phone (yes, I actually make calls on my phone... I'm old).The rear camera is fine... far better than my photography, that's for sure. I don't do selfies, so I don't know how well the front camera works (as indicated above, I'm old).The sound is MUCH better than the Samsung, both from the speaker and headphones, and the music program is easy to use and plays FLAC files.It is light enough that even with an armored case it isn't too heavy, and I quickly got used to the size. It is easier to carry on my belt, but it fits in my pocket. The S6 seems too small to me now, and I will almost certainly get another 5.5" phone next time..I would have no hesitation buying another Alcatel phone when this one is ready to retire in another year or two. Or maybe three if it keeps working, since it certainly is meeting my phone, e-mail, snapshot and web surfing needs very well. p
Decent phone, shame it died one day after the one year warranty ended. It was while I was playing kingdom hearts unchained x. Symptoms were: phone got hot, touch screen became unresponsive on and off, the next day blue screen, rebooted, another blue screen, then phone completely died.Dual front facing speakers that get nice and loud so that's a huge plus, mine came with jbl earbuds which is awesome considering how most phones don't even include them anymore. But, the placement of the auxiliary port is located at the top of the phone and this is weird because the mini usb port is located on the bottom. If you used one of those magnetic air vent phone holders for you car, things will get messy as there's no clear orientation to have good cable management when you want to plug the auxiliary cable to your phone while charging. However, the reversible design is nice so that you can make the auxiliary cable be located on the bottom relatively by putting the phone upside down.Coming from a samsung galaxy s3, the idol 3's screen is much more vibrant. Also the phone is about 7mm thin which is just 1mm thicker than the thinnest phone out there. Also you should plan on getting a case for the phone, the back of this phone is really slippery with zero grip which is awful for such a thin phone. So if you get sweaty hands due to the heat emitted from this phone, the chance of it falling is quite high. Another plus was that alcatel did provide a software update to Android Marshmallow, which no one thought they would do considering the idol 4 was coming out, the idol 3 was made by a chinese company which don't really provide software support, and that the idol 3 was a budget phone. The stock os doesn't really come with a lot of bloat, although surprisingly, the clock app that comes with the phone is actually made by avg, the same guys that make the antivirus, which no one would have found out until one day play store decided to update the clock app. The updated clock app was terrible because it went away from the google's material design to some awkward interface. The average rating was around 2 stars before avg reverted back to the original clock app. The biggest con I would have to mention is the very slow flash storage, this is really noticeable when you load files or install apps in the play store.Oh well, time to get a new phone and this is just a lesson to always back up your texts and photos as well as get an extended warranty if you plan on using the phone for a very long time. Especially on devices like these where there is no removable back cover. I set the expected usage to a year anyways when I bought the phone considering it was only 250 when I bought it. The phone did get cheaper, but that's to be expected as time goes on.-----update 9/13/16---------Wow, so they still honored the warranty when my phone died. Fantastic service; they went above and beyond. They shipped the phone back with 2 day ups air too. n
I received a paper stapler . not buy cell.The order gives me the option to open a claim as I do please . n
I Love the Simplicity of this phone and even though its kind of big but it feels good in hand ....Performance is Awesome after upgrading it to marshmallow....Both rear and front cameras are performing well and it did capture good pics in good light conditions but its kind of ok when u don't have adequate lights.... The Call quality is good and audio quality is great but got disappointed when it didn't arrive with the JBL headset (that's why the 4 Star)....overall i am satisfied with the purchase and i would recommend to everyone who wants to have a good smart phone for the daily use........ p
Had this phone for 6 months now with no issues. Works just as well and better than any $700 phone I have had. Seriously folks, it's a phone. We call, we text and we surf the web, why pay $700 for the newest Samsung. It's crazy. Will never buy another high priced phone again. p
I wanted a phone to last all day and I'm not disappointed. It easily lasts all day with various uses and everything about it runs smoothly. p
Design > Very GoodBuild quality > GoodDisplay > AverageSpeakers > Very GoodPerformance > Ok ( Android 6.0.1 )Battery Life > GoodPrice > Very Good n

Great starting phone. Decent camera provided on a low end phone. Works fine and meets expectations. p
Good p
VERY GOD p
A great phone p
Wanted a basic, easy to use device for my grandma and this phone fit the profile. She seems to enjoy her new phone so no complains. p
bien p
Very good. p
OK so I got this and it was nice but I couldn't use it because I wanted straight talk and it was gmi or CDMA or GSM one of the two and was not compatible with my cell towers. I live in a rural area with limited Internet and cell phone service. I would buy from a local store. Especially your local Walmart if you want straight talk like me. p
I bought this as a backup phone. It works well for what it is, a cheep smartphone. It wont play much for games or videos but music internet and social media it works decently enough. The battery both dies and charges fast and there is not much in the way of space on the phone but all in all I am ok with my purchase and would recomend anyone looking for a cheep backup or starter phone to give this a try. n
Not programed fo at&t n
Good phone p
Great phone really, but I cracked the screen and there's no offer up to replace itðŸ˜”ðŸ˜–ðŸ™…By the way what is the max for storage? p
Seems to be a good value. p
Worked p
Worked without a glitch in the UK with a local SIM bought at Heathrow and just as well in Eastern Europe. Great phone for the price. Make sure you have the correct international plugs to use with the charger p
Really slow to operate and inaccurate reflection when touch the screen. p
Excellent product. I recommend very happy. p
for the price is what you get, I would like to have the old school designs, with some modern functions, but now every cellphone seems to be very generic product on that segment, the screen is not so responsive, and it feels very very slow. for that segment of price I recommend a windows phone with abetter touchscreen. n
Phone was purchased as a gift in Mexico. Phone works great especially for the price. Good reception and doesn't drop calls. Recommend. p
Alcatel Pixi3 great mobile with all function of smart phone.. I enjoyed when i received my Pixi3..afterwoed my little son synced a wrong google email,now i'm not able to access the phone it has been asking for the first and validate google account...i dont remember the account... I had tried all account no success..Please i need help how to reboot the phone fpr new setup.... n
does not work with safelink, verizon unlocked phone n
the phone is very good, 4,5-inch screen, touch very docile, is very nice, very well built, equipped and bluetooth, Gps, wifi, 3G, android kit kat 4.4.2, play store, whatsapp, and all applications android, finally very good phone, very low cost p
It's good for the price front camera is working well. p
I like price Vs performance. Its a good phone. p
Is a great phone for the price, it is durable and does all the relevant things any modern phone can do. If you are looking for a simple and cheap workable smartphone don't look far. p
Nice phone! p

The phone instrument is too frail and the touch is not friendly. Have not had the phone more than a month but I am not happy with it. n
Great compact, economical phone. The only downside is the internal storage space. I can't even fit Twitter on my new phone as it wants to install everything on the internal memory. n
Good phone. Responsive. Works well with Tracfone SIM card installed. Does not have unneeded propriatary apps from other cell phone providers (like an unlocked ATT&T GSM phone I had used that was a Huawei Fusion.But note carefully: It does NOT have 8 GB of internal storage! The description on this page is OFF on two locations, 1) on the heading itself and 2) in the comparison chart.Amazon sent a replacement and it had the same amount of internal storage: 4 GB. So far I have used 2.1 GB of the 4 GB. Whenever I download a new app, I make sure it is stored (if possible) to the 32 GB SD card I have in it. So far, so good, but be aware.I have contacted Customer Service and they are supposed to change the product page to reflect the 4 GB truth. p
THE PONE WAS WORKING GREAT, BUT AFTER 5 MONTHS I DON'T KNOW WHY THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SCREEN SUDDENLY IS GOING CRAZY!! HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP ME!! n
great basic phone for whatsapp instagram messenger twitter facebook etr p
No p
Perfect p
it was as expected p
It's nice. I'm using it with my government sim card. It makes a good replacement phone for the Obama phone. p
I wish I could give it 4.75 stars, but 4 doesn't seem like enough, so I gave it 5. For $65 ($60 as I write this), I have exactly as much phone as I want and need. Sure, the screen could be better, and I miss having an ambient light sensor, but otherwise I'm very happy. It's small enough to fit in my front pants pocket while cycling, TCL's Android is nearly stock and I get two full days on a charge. I "upgraded" from a first-gen Moto E, and this adds LTE, a flash (most for the flashlight), and a camera with focus.). Not bad for about half the price two years later. p
good for the price. n
Excelent phone ! p
Returned because didnt start the oper. System after the updates n
I bought this little fella for a cousin living out the country and so far so good, it works perfectly for the price. Good phone for a good price. p
Its a good cheap phone p
Surprisingly good. Recommended! NOTE: Not compatible with Cardboard! p
the phone is very good, 4,5-inch screen, touch very docile, is very nice, very well built, equipped and bluetooth, Gps, wifi, 3G, 4G Lte android lollipop 5.1, play store, whatsapp, and all applications android, finally very good phone, very low cost p
I have been using this phone for a couple of weeks now. I really don't need a pricey smartphone so this one is perfect for me. I can check my mail, facebook, Ig and twitter without problems. I have downloaded a few other apps and written letters using wps app.It has a nice sized screen and eventhough it's a bit heavier than my huawei it's ok.I have taken really nice pictures .The only downside is the keyboard , I find the letters quite small p
good p
I got it for less than 60 bucks. Have had it for like two weeks and I have no complains so far.The Camera could be better (specially the front facing) but is not that bad [I'm not a selfie fan anyway].The system is fluid. It works better than muy old BLU Avance 4 which was kind of slow.Speaker quality is also not the best, but to me not a big deal.I'm happy with it, considering what I paid.'''''''''''''''''''''UPDATE''''''''''''''''''''''''''Well, just after 5 months with this cellphone, it DIED. Not even a year it lasted.I was happy with it.Now it just will not turn on.I plug in the charger and the LED turns on but that's it. n
Just what I was looking for. Lots of memory. p
A few things are less than perfect like answering when it rings. You have to swipe to answer and it often doesn't take. It does what I need it to and is a great value for the money. p
good n
I love this phone, especially given the modest cost. It performs well on Freedompop and does not slow down at all as I keep adding applications. Excellent button recognition, even with large fingers. p
I needed a cheap phone to just be able to call, use whatsapp, listen to Spotify and use Runkeeper, and occasionally go online (no fancy app or game), and this phone is just perfect for that. No crash so far (I've had it for 6 months). p
Great little phone for the price, works great, I get 4G LTE and it works well on T-Mobile. So far I am loving it! p
I love it. It is marvelous, quickly, smart, and have everithing! p
The phone I received is model number 5017O-2AALUS1, which meets the description of the "Global" Pixie 3 4.5" -- with one notable exception: It has 4.28GB of total memory, not 8GB.I'm including screen shots from "Settings-Storage" and "Settings--About Phone" which show the model number and actual memory of my phone. This was a disappointment since I need and expected 8GB. I have since tried without success to find a Pixi 3 4.5" with 8GB of memory.While it is too limited to be my primary phone at home, I am keeping it to use while traveling in Europe. In addition to the 4G LTE frequencies used by AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM operators on this side of the pond, it has the primary European 4G LTE frequency. My home phone does not.On the whole, this is a suitable phone for beginners, those on a budget, and anyone who doesn't need enough memory to run a lot of apps. The screen resolution is less than on more expensive models, which means text and images appear larger. On a 4.5-inch screen, that's a nice benefit for people like me who are a tad hard of seeing. n
Very disappointing overall unlocked phone says, but Venezuela did not work for me digitel 4g Lte, is a failure because in the comments and said that if work specifications. n
I like this ALCATEL OneTouch Pixi 3 4.5-inch CELL PHONE!The 4.5" size is not too big for my hand! I thought I'd never want anything bigger than my 3.5" ipod, but I am able to hold this in one hand and touch the buttons without any difficulty.As a phone -- it works great -- I can hear clearly and so can the person on the other end. So far, no problems with sound at all.The camera works fine -- takes a good, clear photo. There are TWO cameras -- one front for FaceTime or Skype and one on the back for taking photos.The mobile operating system -- Android Lollipop 5.0 -- has so far allowed me to make calls without any problems.It's UNLOCKED. Global System for Mobile (GSM) for mobile communication means that I will be able to change the SIM card when I go to Europe. (At least I hope so -- I haven't tried this yet.) It also means I can change from AT&T to a different carrier if I wish to in the future. I can use pre-paid wireless plans, rather than sign up for a long-term contract -- I like these features!It holds a charge for days. I don't use this much, but I can leave it on for days before it needs to be charged. If I talked on it constantly, I assume it would need charging more often.Screen shows time and date, strength of mobile signal and wifi signal and battery charge percentage. On screen quick use icons: phone, music, calculator, camera, contact list, product code scanner. After you swipe icons: phone, messaging, menu, email, google, camera, gallery. Press Google and several icons for different apps appear. Press menu and 20 icons appear for different apps.Why do I like it and not love it -- it didn't come with a SIM. I tried to get a Tracfone SIM package at Walmart but they didn't have it. They could order it, though. I went to the at&t store where the sales associate put in the SIM and sold me a package that got progressively more expensive as we went along. First it was $25 -- okay, not too bad. Then another $30 for "RTR" (a month's worth of minutes?), then a 40-cent FEE, AND TAX $3.85. I got out of there for $59.25 for the SIM and one month of service! Add this to the cost of the phone and one hopes that this is a phone that will work well for years. (I realize I have to add more minutes and this will cost more.) One big benefit -- the sales rep installed the SIM, let me select from a list of potential phone numbers and then swiped through a series of installation menus. (Thank you Dyllan!)One caveat: I noticed that the sales rep had to scratch off the waxy surface on the SIM package. These "shavings" stick to the fingers and could easily get on the SIM card, which is quite small, and "gum up" the electronics when the card slips into its slot.This comes with earphones, a manual, charger plug and an in-depth online manual and online support. I couldn't find much online information about installing the SIM and depended on amazon's great Q&A feature and the advice of some very helpful and supportive people. p
Good cell phone, is like the description, is unlocked for Digitel and Movistar in Venezuela p
Â Let's get the specs out of the way. You can find specs online for this model, but I'll make it easy and list the biggies for you:Originally launched in August of 2015Phone Size: 5.55 x 2.81 x 0.39 inDisplay: 480x854 pixels (196 ppi density) This isn't super great but it's respectable, especially if this is your first smart phone!Lollypop OS, likely wonâ€™t be upgraded to Marshmallow (that is a guess â€“ I donâ€™t know that for sure but Marshmallow is getting pushed out now) Dual core processorMemory: Internal 8 GB, 1 GB RAM (4G model, which this is) also a micro SD slot up to 32GB but you must add that yourself, it is not included.Camera is a 5 megapixel. Has auto focus, Flash, Geo-taging. Video is 720p at 30 frames per second.. Selfie mode is 2 mp.Has Bluetooth capabilities, and GPS.Battery is a removable and is a 1400mAh battery.What to like about it? It's an inexpensive entry level phone. If you live in an area that gets good service from the providers they listed this would be an excellent option. If you live in an area where you can only get Verizon service (which this phone is not compatible with) then this would not be a good choice as a cell phone. Research what carrier people in your area use to see if it is one of the recommended ones.I found it to be pretty responsive, and it works just like my more expensive Note 4. Google Play store access, and most everything runs fine on this phone that I tested out.This phone has the advantage of the SD slot to add extra memory, which I did. In this way I can put all my movies and music on there and have them handy all the time. 32GB is fairly large and you can fit a lot on there.The battery is removable so if you wanted to buy an extra battery to "swap out" in emergencies if you didn't have a way to charge it - that is so handy. I do that with my other phone and I feel sorry for people without removable batteries. I travel a lot and so having that is a huge win.What not to like about it? For me the screen is way too small. But I am used to a HUGE phablet style phone. So for me the small screen seems like a downgrade. You may not feel that way though... it is subjective.Who is this phone good for? First time smart phone users for sure. For kids who you don't want to spend a lot of money to have a phone for, but still need a smart phone. Or budget conscious people. This phone is not very costly. These are the three main groups. p
my brother love this phone i send this phone back in philippines and very well preformance p
Item arrived 1.5 weeks late! I requested -and paid- for a 2-day shipment and did not receive the item on time.Quality was good. As expected.Case is black, but its back side has some shining pieces...which may be OK for women but not for men. Item description unfortunately did not clarify this. n

Not a global 4G LTE band, don't suport (B3)I bought this phone because I thought it was really unlocked 4G LTE world is global and even 3G UMTS is only ( 2G) GSM Quad Band Unlocked n
good p
This is a good phone for the price, runs latest android and all needed apps very smoothly. Can do everything except take good selfies because the front camera isnt very good, but still usable in decent amount of light. Perfect for people who want to run a large selection of apps for a cheap price. p
Very nice p

For the price, this model from Alcatel is pretty good for those seeking budget phones w/ features. p
Desided to keep this product after thankyou p
I bought this phone as a gift for my friend in Russia. My own phone (LG) cost me $100 and it's great! So the price and the features of ALCATEL OneTouch Pop 3 Global Unlocked 4G satisfied me too.First of all I didn't like both cameras. I'm into photography, I DO know how 5MP and 2MP pictures look like. So the front camera is not even remotely close to 2MP (probably 0.3 or MAX 1MP). The main camera is not that bad but pics come out A LITTLE BIT worse than 5MP. Even though I set both cameras to the highest quality.Well it's okay. Not a big deal... I guess.What has REALLY disappointed me is language settings!!! Yes, this phone has a keyboard in (I guess) any language. You can type in EN, Russian, German etc. BUT there are only FOUR languages available to set as the main language. The phone's menu can be in English, French, Spanish or Italian ONLY. Tha'ts it! I understand that English is an international language but not everyone speaks English! My friend in Russia doesn't! Even my own phone has a bunch of languages including Russian.The menu, apps, notifications are in EN.I spent all day searching for any apps or drivers that could help me to add more languages. Nothing! Btw there are no official drivers for this phone. When I hooked up it to my computer it showed me that it had its own drivers. I clicked "install" and NOTHING happened.I am still going to send it to my friend but if only we find out it is not GSM unlocked I will get it back to the US and return to Amazon. I just have a hard time to believe the features that the company has claimed.P.s. I am actually returning this product because I do not trust its description. I don't want to risk and spend more money. n
The phone is messed up do mot ever turn the phone off or reboot because the phone goes only as far as where it says alcatel onetouch i can't use my phone this day 2 and still can't use it. n
Its a good phone so far no problems incounterd reliable. p
Price was very good,nice look and feel. Many apps run just as well as other top phones but at 1/4 the cost. If you buy one order a good screen protector and put it on first thing. Now that I had it a while comparing it to a flagship model isn't fair but how many can you buy for the price of a flagship ? about 4 to 6 depending on which you chose. Add a 2 year warranty and that beat my carriers protection policy hands down. p
Great! p
Not sure if I just got a defective one, but it's slow, laggy, freezes, and heats up easily. n
Very Pleased! p
The phone (ALCATEL OneTouch Pop 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD Display, 8GB (GSM - US Warranty)) stopped working this morning, won't turn on, I tried everything, nothing work. I took it to a mobile store and ask for help, they tried turn it on and nothing happened, after several attempts the phone finally turned on. I worry this happen again, Do I should return it and ask for a new one or a refund? n
I bought this phone for my mom a few weeks ago and after about a week of usage it stopped working. The phone is dead and will not turn on no matter what we try. And to make things even worse, the day it stopped working was the day after we could no longer return it.I see a 2 year warranty sticker on the packaging, does anyone have any information on how I can contact the seller here? I've looked all through the product listing and I don't see any contact information. We would like a new phone or our money back please and thank you. n
This phone is a very nice size. Easy to start up just insert the SIM card and turn on. My problem is the phone is very slow. I bought this for my husband he likes it. It is a good phone for a beginner. I also bought a phone for myself and returned it after several weeks. I could not handle the slow processing speed. When I returned the phone the seller credited my account as soon as UPS scanned the package in. Excellent customer service. n
Disappointed with the phone compared to there idol 3 model I ordered several days ago . The display is no were near as bright and vibrant and its slow when downloading and switching between different screens. It will serve its purpose which is to be used as my travel phone when I go out of the country and I dont wont to bring my good phone with me in-case it lost or stolen . n
It is of high quality comparable to Samsung galaxy note. Pretty good. I recomend everyone to use this phone.Thanks p
Super smarter-than-me phone, great for a newbie such as myself. I just wish the user's manual had print big enough to read. Even with my 2.5x reading glasses, I have to use a magnifying glass. p
This phone was great for about the first week I had it. Now I have to restart it about 2x a day because it freezes so much. It has trouble connecting to the WIFI, and it runs really slow. It has about a gig of space left on it, and none of the apps I use are very heavy. Not to mention I close them all the time! Going to be looking for a new phone very soon. Will not buy again. n
worth the price n

Review after one week usage. No issues so far and completely satisfied.Its unlocked with dual sim.Sim card size is microI am using ultra mobile sim and an Indian sim on the phone, both works fineit also has 4G LTE p
Good product. But beware on pricing. I bought this in early December, and 5 days later Amazon reduced the price by $20! Unlike the better B&M stores, unless it is a TV Amazon will NOT provide any price adjustment or offer refunds based on their new price. I chatted, called and talked to several supervisors and their only solution was to mail the product back, then re-order the phone at the lower price. I kindly pointed out that shipping costs and my time would be more than the $20 and it seemed a better solution to offer a "store credit" to a long time Prime member. Long story short, no dice. Sine the phone is activated already I am not about to return it and start the activation process all over again either.So, just know that while Amazon is eager to take your money if the price goes UP, they will not offer any relief if within as little time as one week they reduce the price (in this case by 25%). So while the phone is a good investment, not sure about Amazon customer flexibility. p
This phone is NOT a premium device if that is what you were expecting. However is is a good solid phone for those looking for an Android device on a budget. It's relatively snappy. The front and back camera, although a bit grainy, are 2 and 5 megapixels respectively have auto-focus, and produce adequate photos for this price range. The SD card slot lets you expand internal storage for apps and photos. It also has dual sims for those that travel, or for those who use different carriers for voice and data. Overall a good device for $70 and a product that I recommend for those on a budget. p
I looked at a lot of phones for under $100 and this simply has the best specs for $59. Some other reviews gave fewer stars because it doesn't have a cool, glossy feel or the glass front shows finger prints ... really?! IT'S $59. We're using it as a second phone for some international travel and it's perfect. Google Maps, WhatsApp, etc. are pre-loaded. It's got 1.5 RAM and 16MB internal memory (if you see 1.0 and 8, it's a misprint), 5" screen, and it's very thin to boot. And dual SD card slots for more memory. No one else has all that. BLU phones all have 512 RAM, 4 MB memory ... you can't even load Google Maps with that. For most people, this would be perfect for an everyday phone. p

We ordered two of these and were excited when we received them - until they started making random calls. n
I have had this phone for less than 24 hours and it reboots itself over and over. Will be returning today. n
Very happy with this product! For now is working good. If have something i edit this review. Good Phone so far!!! Still working very good! 30/9/16 p
please note the description of this phone, it clearly states the phone is unlocked, well the phone I received was LOCKED. I lost a week of service from straight talk because the phone did not work(like an unlocked phone should) this is/was so frustrating! How do you make this right? p
just great, best value for money. p
Not too shabby p
Its basic and good. decent camera and speed is OK. p
I was previously using both a BlackBerry Z10 and a 7" Kindle Fire. I needed a new phone and the Kindle was dropped.. I figured that I would get the best of both worlds. This phone does what is advertised, it has a nice looking screen and I can tell the speed is faster than the Z10 and on par with the Kindle I was using. I think the stats on this device are certainly mid-level but I have had no issues using it overseas. The battery life is unremarkable and I'm sure there are better screens but so far so good. For the price you can't beat it especially for traveling overseas, it has too SIM card slots also. I almost wish I had gotten a 5 inch screen this is a little big... p
what accessories you get with the phone p
This is a great android phone for the price. I was surprised to learn that the phone has 2 sims slots and a slot for a micro SD card for more memory. My previous phone would immediately recognize external memory with my music.. However I have found that this phone does not immediately identify external memory, through the micro USB port. It may be a software issue? However, I can add up to a 128 GB micro SD card internally. I can load plenty of photos, music and other media.I prefer a 6 inch display but it is very difficult to find a case. There are various pouches available but an otterbox type case/cover has been almost impossible to find. p
I have previously had brand name phones on contract my last one being Samsung Note Edge (5" screen). Never again. This phone is excellent. The screen is clear and the 6" size is awesome. volume is loud, GPS works great, call quality is clear. Photos are adequate with the 5MP camera, battery life is great. The home screen it comes with is nice but I installed Nova Settings app which is even better. I also installed the Swiftkey app to replace the stock Android keyboard. I am using it on Straight Talk AT&T and have a great signal.I had previously tried the Posh E600 and this is far better for about the same price or less. p
First off I loved the phone! Then out of nowhere it shuts down and reboots out of nowhere!! It is seriously passing me off and going back to the windows 10 phone!!!!! n
Love my phone. I get bored with phones very quick and purchase a "new" phone off Amazon almost every 6 months, sometimes sooner but I am hoping this will be my last. Trying to find a 6" phone with the latest updated software AND for a very good price takes allot of research. I almost purchased a 5.5" phone but at the last minute I saw this Alcatel PIXI 4 so snapped it up. I was hesitant to show my phone around if it said PIXI on it but thank goodness it does not.. Phone performs well and sound is not bad (still prefer my Nexus 6 for sound quality). In have yet to figure out the SD card issue I seem to have with this phone unless it's happening with other android devices too. I am using Net10 on the Lte network and its running well. I am having wi fi issues but not sure if its phone related or my home network which has been an issue. p
decent dual sim phone that gets the job done. The display is good but the the ZEN UI is not my cup of tea. Button layout are a bit to high up for me but it gets the job done as a backup phone. This does not work with Verizon or Sprint but works fine with ATT. I do recommend getting a case and tempered glass since the product feels cheap. p
Runs really smooth, near stock Android, really great screen, good speaker. Fingerprint scanner and camera are just ok. If you aren't a major multi-tasker the phone runs just fine. All in all a great value. p
Simple which I like p
This was a Christmas present and the user is well satisfied with it. It was an upgrade from a much older phone. She finds it easier to text and to use. p
This was an improvement upon the old one. I still have issue with this one too. My first one had a white screen, and after buying a new one (this one) i found out it cant hold a charge. So if i need to charge it i have to use my old one to charge the battery then swap them out. Maybe its just bad luck but honestly i would recommend buying a different brand or model. n
Everything I expected it to be Thanks p
Terrible n
This phone comes in a kit. The kit is incomplete as the SIM card has been removed. In addition, the phone itself is refurbished. Returned for a refund. n
GOOD ITEM p
not true to size n
Great phone for the nonsmart phone type of person. Easy to unlock and navigate. p
Horribe customer service. Phone just "exploded" after one month, vendor asked if I dropped in or had in water (I dropped once, but having had bought this model several times before, this type of phone tends to last a year before breaking even if dropped). Furthermore, there are other vendors selling this "new" phone (which actually T-Mobile discontinued, so it is bordering on false advertising not to mention this fact) for half the price that this vendor sold it to me for-quite the rip off! n
